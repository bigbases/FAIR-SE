0,1,NBC News,"Pregnancy deaths rose by 56% in Texas after 2021 abortion ban, analysis finds",,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631,"The number of women in Texas who died while pregnant, during labor or soon after childbirth skyrocketed following the state s 2021 ban on abortion care — far outpacing a slower rise in maternal mortality across the nation, a new investigation of federal public health data finds.  From 2019 to 2022, the rate of maternal mortality cases in Texas rose by 56%, compared with just 11% nationwide during the same time period, according to an analysis by the Gender Equity Policy Institute. The nonprofit research group scoured publicly available reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shared the analysis exclusively with NBC News.   There s only one explanation for this staggering difference in maternal mortality,  said Nancy L. Cohen, president of the GEPI.  All the research points to Texas  abortion ban as the primary driver of this alarming increase.    Texas, I fear, is a harbinger of what s to come in other states,  she said.  The SB 8 effect  The Texas Legislature banned abortion care as early as five weeks into pregnancy in September 2021, nearly a year before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the case that protected a federal right to abortion — in June 2022.  At the time, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, lauded the bill as a measure that  ensures the life of every unborn child.   Texas law now prohibits all abortion except to save the life of the mother.  The passage of Texas  Senate Bill 8 gave GEPI researchers the opportunity to take an early look at how near-total bans on abortion — including cases in which the mother s life was in danger — affected the health and safety of pregnant women.  The SB 8 effect, Cohen s team found, was swift and stark. Within a year, maternal mortality rose in all racial groups studied.  Among Hispanic women, the rate of women dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after increased from 14.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 to 18.9 in 2022. Rates among white women nearly doubled — from 20 per 100,000 to 39.1. And Black women, who historically have higher chances of dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after, saw their rates go from 31.6 to 43.6 per 100,000 live births.While maternal mortality spiked overall during the pandemic, women dying while pregnant or during childbirth rose consistently in Texas following the state s ban on abortion, according to the Gender Equity Policy Institute.   If you deny women abortions, more women are going to be pregnant, and more women are going to be forced to carry a pregnancy to term,  Cohen said.  Beyond the immediate dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, there is growing evidence that women living in states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas, are far more likely to go without prenatal care and much less likely to find an appointment with an OB-GYN.  Doctors say the feeling among would-be moms is fear.   Fear is something I d never seen in practice prior to Senate Bill 8,  said Dr. Leah Tatum, an OB-GYN in private practice in Austin, Texas. Tatum, who was not involved with the GEPI study, said that requests for sterilization procedures among her patients doubled after the state s abortion ban.  That is, women prefer to lose their ability to ever have children over the chance that they might become pregnant following SB 8.   Patients feel like they re backed into a corner,  Tatum said.  If they already knew that they didn t want to pursue pregnancy, now they re terrified.   Tatum said she s seeing many women in their late 30s and 40s who, even though they d like to have a child, worry they wouldn t have an option to end the pregnancy if it turned out that the baby wouldn t be born healthy.   What happens if I end up with a genetically abnormal fetus?   Tatum said her patients have asked her. They worry their options are limited, she said.  Treated like a criminal   That unthinkable tragedy happened to Kaitlyn Kash, 37, of Austin, Texas.  Kash had a textbook pregnancy with her first child, a healthy little boy, born in 2018.   It d been so easy the first time,  she said.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think we would go down the journey that we went down.   When she became pregnant again, it wasn t until Kash s second trimester, at 13 weeks, that she and her husband, Cory, discovered that their fetus had severe skeletal dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder affecting bone and cartilage growth. It was highly unlikely the baby would survive.   We were told that his bones would break in utero and he would suffocate at birth,  Kash said.  We were expecting our doctor to tell us how we were going to care for our baby, how we were going to end his pain. It was October 2021, just a month after Texas passed the SB 8 abortion law.   We were told that we should get a second opinion, but make sure that it was outside of Texas,  she said.  At 15 weeks, Kash had to travel to Kansas to terminate her doomed pregnancy. Outside the medical clinic, protesters harassed the grief-stricken mom.   I was being treated like a criminal,  she said.  I didn t get the dignity that I deserved to say goodbye to my child.    It s just another example of how it s heartbreaking to practice in the state of Texas,  Tatum said.  These patients are asking for help. The state of Texas has failed women. "
0,2,CNN,"She claimed she aborted her baby at nine months. In this country, there’s no law against that",,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/asia/south-korea-abortion-youtube-video-intl-hnk/index.html,"A South Korean vlogger who claimed to have terminated her pregnancy at 36 weeks is being investigated for murder in a case that s prompted horror in South Korea and raised urgent questions about why the country has no abortion laws.  Seoul National Police began investigating the woman in July at the request of the South Korean government, after she posted a video to YouTube purportedly documenting her experience of getting an abortion, police told CNN.  Abortions past 24 weeks are banned in many jurisdictions, or reserved for very exceptional cases, such as fetal anomalies or when the mother s health is at risk.  But in South Korea, there are no laws governing when, where or how abortions can take place – and there haven t been for almost four years.  It s a policy vacuum that experts say not only opens the door to potential malpractice but also hinders access to safe abortions, with women and doctors forced to navigate a state of legal uncertainty.  In a joint statement, a coalition of 11 South Korean women s organizations and NGOs slammed the government for pursuing women who terminate pregnancies rather than improving access to abortion care.   This is nothing short of a pathetic and serious attempt to evade responsibility and shift blame,  the statement said.  A legal hole  For more than six decades, performing an abortion in South Korea was a crime punishable by up to two years in prison, with limited exceptions for rape, incest, and threat to the health of the mother or the baby.  Pregnant women who chose to terminate could also be jailed for up to one year.  But in 2019, South Korea s Constitutional Court overturned that ban, giving the National Assembly until the end of 2020 to enact new abortion laws, which the court recommended should include a term limit of 22 weeks.  When the legislature failed to meet that deadline, the criminal provisions around abortion expired, effectively legalizing abortion at any stage of pregnancy.  By not passing abortion laws, the National Assembly is  not doing its job,  said Cho Hee-kyoung, a law professor at Hongik University in Seoul.   If there is no law criminalizing a conduct, then there is no crime for carrying out that conduct,  Cho said.  Decriminalization of abortion was a major win for reproductive rights advocates, who at the time faced stern opposition from conservative and religious groups, some linked to US anti-abortion campaigns.  But their victory has been dampened by what s come – or hasn t come – in the years since.   Since the criminality of abortion was banned, we have been asking the health and welfare ministry to classify abortion as a right of health, not as a subject of punishment, and to come up with policies,  said Nayoung, a representative for SHARE, an organization in South Korea that provides services related to sexual and reproductive health and rights.  But no new policies have passed. Instead, debates in the National Assembly about abortion policies have faced renewed opposition from religious groups, which hold powerful sway with lawmakers in a country where traditional gender norms dominate.  In a statement posted to its website in June, the country s Ministry of Justice said  the direction, details, and timing of the revision  of abortion laws have not yet been decided, and that it needs to consult with the Health and Welfare Ministry, which oversees the Maternal and Child Health Act.   The Ministry of Justice will do its best to discuss the issue so that the right to life of the fetus, and the right to health and the right to self-determination of the pregnant woman can be harmonized,  the statement added.  The Health and Welfare Ministry told CNN that it will  actively support the legislative process  with the current National Assembly, as proposed revisions had all expired with the end of the previous parliament term in May.  Changing attitudes to abortion  Despite the country previously having highly restrictive abortion laws, abortion has not historically been the lightning rod in South Korea that it has been in the United States.  Between the 1960s and the mid-2000s, the South Korean government strongly emphasized family planning to curb population growth, to the point that abortion was seen as an  alternative method of birth control,  said Cho, the law professor.  Social stigma placed upon single and unwed mothers also facilitated the hushed acceptance of abortion, she said.  Even police officers and their wives, prosecutors and their wives and mistresses, were getting abortions.   While abortion has long been allowed to operate in the shadows, authorities began cracking down on the procedure in the mid-2000s.  Doctors were charged with performing abortions, prompting a court challenge that sought to safeguard the rights of women to seek an abortion and for doctors to provide them.  At the same time, South Korea s birth rate was dropping and the government was seeking ways to boost the population. Along with new forms of contraception that could prevent pregnancies, the public mood towards abortion shifted, according to Cho.   It s not something that people take lightly, and people might tend to see it as being somewhat irresponsible,  she said.  If overpopulation had once prompted the government to push abortions, South Korea was now dealing with the opposite problem.  South Korea s fertility rate was 0.72 children per woman in 2023, according to government figures, far below the 2.1 rate the OECD estimates a country needs to achieve population stability without immigration. By comparison, the fertility rate in the US was 1.7 in 2022, according to the World Bank.  Fertility rates below 1.5 can plunge countries into a trap where low fertility drives population aging and economic stagnation – further deterring childbearing and driving the fertility rate lower.  It is impossible to know the true number of abortions that take place each year in South Korea because the procedure is unregulated.  There s no reliable historical comparison because back when abortion was still a crime, patients would pay hospitals in cash so there was no official record, said Nayoung, from SHARE.  But according to estimates from South Korea s Institute for Health and Social Affairs, the number of abortions has fallen drastically in recent decades, from an estimated 241,411 in 2008 to just 32,063 in 2020, the last year for which statistics are available.  Advocates say the true abortion rate is likely much higher.  Abortion pills banned  In the absence of clear regulations, women and abortion providers currently operate in a gray area with little guidance as to what is permitted and what might break other laws.  Credible information about where to get an abortion is hard to come by, and the procedure is not covered under the country s public health system.  Often, women will rely on word of mouth to find a clinic that will perform an abortion, at a cost of hundreds of dollars that they must pay out of pocket, said Susanné Seong-eun Bergsten, an officer in the women s rights division for Human Rights Watch.   Women are really suffering,  said Bergsten.  They ve been waiting for five years for something to change.   While surgical abortion is now technically legal, abortion medication – which offers a safe, affordable and effective way to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages – is not, underscoring the difficulty women in South Korea still face in exercising their reproductive rights.  In May, a South Korean court rejected an appeal by Women on Web (WoW), a Canadian NGO that delivers abortion pills by mail, and digital rights organization Open Net Korea, to open access to the WoW website, which has been blocked in South Korea since 2019.  Access to the WoW website was blocked at the order of Korea s Communication Standards Committee, which oversees broadcasting content and the internet, for violating the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act by selling the abortion-inducing pill mifepristone, the committee told CNN.  Mifepristone blocks the progesterone hormone needed for a pregnancy to continue. When taken with another drug called misoprostol, it can end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks. Both medicines are on the World Health Organization s list of essential medicines.  WoW has filed a final appeal to the Supreme Court.   By blocking the website of such an organization, the government is rather creating an environment where people need to look for unofficial and unsafe pills,  Nayoung said.  No drugs to terminate pregnancies are approved for use in South Korea, and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety told CNN none are being reviewed for potential sale.  In their statement, the 11 women s organizations and NGOs said abortion pills were predominantly available on the black market.   At this point, it is not an exaggeration to say that the government has actually deepened the conditions that lead to more late-term pregnancy terminations and anonymous births,  the statement said.  Entrenched gender norms  While South Korea has done little to support women who want to end their pregnancies, the government has added new supports to encourage pregnant women to carry their babies to term.  In July, South Korea began offering counseling services to pregnant women and new mothers experiencing economic, physical and psychological difficulties.  In a recent report, the government cited what it said were several success stories including the case of a woman who decided not to have an abortion after learning of the added support available to her.  Advocates are skeptical that more liberal abortion laws will pass soon, because of society s attitude towards women.  South Korea has the worst gender wage gap in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and has bottomed out the Economist s glass ceiling index, which measures the role and influence of women in the work force, for more than a decade.  The country s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was elected two years ago pledging to abolish the country s gender equality ministry, and courts support from young anti-feminist men.   (Women) are still seen as the main caretakers of the home, of the children,  Bergsten, from HRW, said.   It s a very old kind of gender stereotype that s still going very strong in South Korea.   It s unclear what motivated the YouTuber to post about her experience online.  Police told CNN they analyzed the video to track down the woman, who is in her 20s, and the hospital allegedly involved in the procedure.  The doctor who allegedly performed the abortion was an obstetrician brought in from another hospital, police told CNN-affiliate YTN, adding that the unnamed hospital initially falsely said it was one of their own doctors.  Along with the woman and the doctor, police are investigating at least five other medical staff who allegedly participated in the abortion, and a broker, YTN reported.  Police told CNN the woman s hospital record said the baby was stillborn, but that she d also admitted to getting an abortion.  If there s enough evidence to prove the baby was born alive, the woman could be charged with murder, said Cho, the law professor. Police will have to find evidence of other crimes, beyond abortion, to place charges in this case, she added.   I think it s difficult to prosecute either doctor or the woman for abortion because the crime of abortion doesn t exist anymore. "
0,3,Rolling Stone,"Josh Hawley Claims He Opposes 'Nationwide' Abortion Ban, But Wants 'Federal Restrictions'",,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/josh-hawley-national-abortion-ban-federal-restrictions-1235108785/,"Conservative Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley claimed Friday he opposes a  nationwide ban  on abortion, before immediately saying he wants to see  reasonable federal restrictions.   One such federal restriction, he said during a Missouri Senate candidate debate on Friday, should be  when the baby is capable of feeling pain  — a phrase mirroring the legislation he co-sponsored to impose a national, 15-week abortion ban.  Hawley also slammed a measure on the ballot this November to restore abortion access in Missouri, which has a near-total abortion ban at any time during pregnancy, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. He falsely claimed the measure would  overturn our ban in the state on transgender surgeries for minors.   The senator and former state attorney general has long described himself as  100 percent pro-life.  In 2021, Hawley said abortion is murder, and compared it to the  moral evil of slavery.  But as abortion bans have become reality in America and politically controversial, he s pretended to take a middle-ground position on abortion, without giving an inch.  In May 2022, as it was becoming clear the conservative-dominated Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion rights, Hawley said he would not support  a federal ban.  He argued the issue should be left to the states — but also that  Congress can look for areas where there s national consensus and act on those.   Several months later, Hawley signed onto the Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children From Late-Term Abortions Act, legislation to ban abortion nationally at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Last year, he called on Republican presidential candidates to support a 15-week national ban, presenting it as a middle-of-the-road view.  I think that there is a national consensus on that,  he said.  Despite supporting a national ban at 15 weeks, during Friday s debate, Hawley claimed,  I don t support a nationwide ban.  He quickly nodded to his actual position:  I do support reasonable federal restrictions — limits on abortion, like partial-birth abortion, like when the baby is capable of feeling pain.   Editor s picks  The legislation that Hawley co-sponsored would create a national 15-week ban, and permit states to enact further restrictions — so bright red states could maintain their near-total abortion bans, and the procedure would be banned in the rest of the country at 15 weeks.  Missouri bans abortion at any time during pregnancy, and contains no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. While the ban has an exception for medical emergencies, a recent letter signed by hundreds of doctors in the state suggests this is not altogether helpful.  Missourians are being denied abortions and forced to continue life-threatening pregnancies, risking their health and lives,  they wrote.  Doctors can t treat patients with heartbreaking pregnancy complications until they are on the brink of death. Otherwise, they could be put in jail.   Though Hawley has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest, he has actively opposed a ballot amendment in Missouri to restore abortion access in the state. He did so again on Friday, claiming the amendment would overturn the state s ban on  transgender surgeries for minors,  adding:  They talk about reproductive health, but what it really does is it allows transgender surgeries for minors without parental consent.   This is false, as Hawley s Democratic opponent Lucas Kunce pointed out Friday.  It has nothing to do with sex-change surgeries,  said Kunce.  He sees mandated sex-change surgeries around every single corner, because he thinks that he s gonna rile people up that way and actually win the election. It s not true.   Related  Hawley doubled down, arguing that liberal groups that support abortion access say  reproductive health care means gender affirming surgeries, it means hormone treatments, it means puberty blockers for minors.  In actuality, Missouri s amendment would simply allow abortions until fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, as was previously the law of the land.  Both Hawley and his wife, Erin, played key roles in convincing the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, paving the way for Missouri s near-total abortion ban to go into effect. Erin Hawley is a lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which said it helped draft the Mississippi abortion law that the high court used to end the federal right to an abortion. She reportedly helped the Mississippi attorney general s office prepare its legal briefs in the case. Josh Hawley, for his part, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court urging justices to overrule Roe.  The senator had previously demanded then-President Donald Trump only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who openly opposed Roe. Hawley also voted against legislation to codify Roe s federal abortion protections before the Supreme Court overturned its landmark 1973 decision.  Trending  At the debate Friday, Hawley tried to frame a return to the previous status quo — legal abortion nationwide — as extreme.   What I will not support is imposing on the state of Missouri, and all the other states, abortion on demand through nine months, with taxpayer funding,  he said.  That s what Lucas Kunce wants. That s what the Democrats in Congress have repeatedly tried to force on us. "

0,5,The Hill,Whitmer calls Trump ‘just deranged’ after weekend comments on women and abortion,,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4892871-gretchen-whitmer-donald-trump-deranged-comments-women-abortion/,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Sunday former President Trump is  just deranged  after he said women won t be thinking about abortion if he s elected in November.   That s just ludicrous,  Whitmer, a co-chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, said in an interview on  State of the Union  with CNN s Jake Tapper about Trump s remarks.  She said Trump doesn t understand the problems women face every day.   I think, you know, this guy just doesn t understand what the average woman is confronting in her life in this country, and how could he? He s not lived a normal life,  Whitmer said.  Unlike Kamala Harris, who has worked hourly jobs, who knows how important it is that women have health care and access to the medical care that they need.    He s just deranged,  she added.  The Michigan governor was responding to Trump s comments at a rally Saturday afternoon, where he said,  Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.   He said the reason women will be happy is that the issue is sent back to the states.  The former president made similar remarks in an online post Friday on his Truth Social platform, suggesting that women would be better off if he were president.   WOMEN ARE POORER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO… AND ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC AND CONFIDENT IN THE FUTURE THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO!  Trump wrote Friday.  He argued that if he s elected, those feelings will be fixed, and  YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES.   Trump s statement Friday night came hours after Vice President Harris gave an abortion-focused speech in Georgia, where she spoke about the pain experienced by women in states with abortion bans and placed the blame for their suffering squarely on Republicans and her GOP rival.  Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded in an emailed statement, blasting Democrats for using  hateful rhetoric.    Kamala Harris and liberal Democrats are the ones who are deranged. There have been two heinous assassination attempts on President Trump, and their violent rhetoric are directly to blame. Their outright lies and weaponization of the justice system to perpetuate countless witch-hunt hoaxes against President Trump have been nothing short of disgusting and abhorrent,  Cheung said in the statement.   If the Democrats and Kamala Harris do not come out and apologize for their hateful rhetoric and tone down their attacks that have stoked the flames of violence, they are explicitly advocating for and inciting more bloodshed against President Trump,  he added.

0,6,Washington Post,Opinion | Late-term abortions are not a myth. They’re happening.,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/20/late-abortion-colorado-doctor/,"In the course of Kamala Harris s charge for reproductive freedom, we ve heard a lot about the 14 states that have banned access to abortion and the 27 others that have restrictions based on gestational duration.  But we ve heard little to nothing about the nine states and the District of Columbia that allow abortion no matter what the age of the fetus. This basically means up until the moment of birth.  Yet during Harris s debate with Donald Trump, the vice president implied that late-term abortions aren t a concern. She said,  Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not an abortion. That is not happening.  When Trump pressed her to say whether she would support abortions in the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy, Harris did not answer.  Story continues below advertisement  We don t like to hear about these procedures because they complicate a preferred understanding that late-term abortions never happen unless some genetic or other physical anomaly would condemn the child to a life of misery and/or early death.  Advertisement  Democrats bent on restoring abortion rights would have us believe that no state would allow a fully formed baby to be aborted, and it is rational to believe this. But such is not always the case. In fact, a doctor profiled in a 2023 Atlantic article, Warren Hern, performs abortions up to 32 weeks and sometimes later. Hern estimated that about half of his later-term abortions are of healthy babies.  Follow Kathleen Parker  Hern, 86, has been performing abortions in Boulder, Colo., for more than 50 years and is one of a handful of doctors willing to perform late-term abortions. He shows no reticence in saying he doesn t care about the fetus, only the living, breathing patient. It is easy to see why he is often described as a curmudgeon, who (proudly) lacks a bedside manner.  Story continues below advertisement  I tend to like curmudgeons; they are usually more interesting than grinning do-gooders who want to direct other people s lives. But a physician who would destroy a fully formed baby after first stopping its heart with a needle isn t my kind of dinner partner. This description, by the way, comes from Hern s own website.  Advertisement  Sometimes, in Hern s procedures, a fetus can be removed whole, but other times it has to be dismembered. All in another wretched day s work, I guess. At least I can appreciate his dislike of euphemisms. When he opened his practice in 1975, he named it the Boulder Abortion Clinic rather than something soothingly nebulous like  women s care.  He said he wanted patients to be able to find him.  Hern and company perform a dozen second- and third-trimester abortions every week, Elaine Godfrey reported in the Atlantic article. It took a while for Hern to become comfortable with his work, which at first took an emotional toll on him. In his mind, he would see the tiny fetuses with still-beating hearts that he had removed from their mothers  wombs. He had bad dreams and sometimes wept, wondering what he was doing.  Story continues below advertisement  Hern felt that it was fair for him to suffer emotional distress as part of the job, and he says he knew deep down that he was helping, not hurting women. This is surely debatable.  Advertisement  Eventually, the dreams stopped and Hern no longer had to compose himself between procedures, wrote Godfrey. He does, however, have to operate with bulletproof glass windows and 24-hour surveillance.  To his credit, the man is honest to a fault. He has given speeches in which he reported that abortion is the destruction of a life.  We have reached a point in this particular technology where there is no possibility of denying an act of destruction,  he told an audience.  It is before one s eyes.   Story continues below advertisement  On the other hand, in a Los Angeles Times article last month, he quoted a 17th-century French physician s description of pregnancy as a  disease of nine months.   During more than three decades of writing about abortion, honesty and truth are all I ve ever hoped for. I m on record encouraging education over judicial fiat as the best way of reducing abortion. Tell women (and men) exactly what abortion is without all the pretend language about  reproductive health,  which doesn t always apply. The least doctors can do is to ensure that their patients are fully informed. Yet, when some states have wanted to require that abortion-seeking women be shown images of their fetuses in utero, the pro-choice brigade has fought back hard.  Advertisement  Most doctors wouldn t remove a gall bladder with as little information as many abortion providers are willing to offer their clients. Are they afraid a woman might change her mind based on a better understanding of what is about to be done?  Story continues below advertisement  In keeping with his sole consideration for his patients  wishes, Hern has aborted at least two later-term babies for sex selection. In one case, the woman wanted a girl, so Hern disposed of a male fetus. In the other, the woman didn t want the daughter she was carrying. Do we really want to codify this deadly game of baby roulette?  I d like to think sex-selection abortion is beyond the comprehension of most people. But abortion culture has had the undesirable, if predictable, effect of making us less horrified by worse and worse. While 90 percent of abortions are performed in the first trimester, a majority of them by pills rather than surgery, even by the 13th and final week of the first trimester, a fetus has begun to look quite human. Although only as big as a pea pod, the fetus has fingerprints, veins and organs, which can be seen through the skin, and, if female, ovaries containing 2 million eggs.  Advertisement  If that s not a human life, what is it? Definitely not nothing.  Story continues below advertisement  At 27 weeks, the last week of the second trimester, the fetus s brain is active, sleeping and waking — eyes wide open — on a regular schedule. Lungs are incomplete, but he or she could survive outside the mother s body even earlier.  This is no matter to the nine states and the District of Columbia. At 32 weeks, when Hern is willing to terminate a nearly fully formed infant, the fetus is settling into the head-down position, preparing for birth. For the remaining seven to eight weeks, it gains a third to half its birth weight, which may be why Hern prefers a 32-week limit, although he ll operate even later. Fully formed babies are a lot more trouble to destroy.  So, yes, Madam Vice President, late-term abortions are happening and not just for anomalies or medical reasons. As we ve learned, you re willing to change your positions based on new information. I hope this helps.  clarification  This column has been updated to more fully detail the exchange about abortion between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during their debate."
0,7,AP News,Federal judge temporarily blocks Tennessee’s ‘abortion trafficking’ law,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trafficking-ban-laws-tennessee-republican-ec78174f1aaec284cb542185593e8aef,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing a law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission.  In a 49-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger argued that the Republican-controlled state cannot  make it a crime to communicate freely  about legal abortion options even in a state where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy except for a handful of situations. Trauger s decision means that the law will be placed on hold as the case make its way through court.   The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is  abortion trafficking,  the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,  Trauger wrote.  Earlier this year, Tennessee s Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on a proposal making it illegal for an adult who  intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports  a pregnant child or teen within the state to get an abortion without consent from the minor s parents or guardians. Those convicted of breaking the law risked being charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires a nearly one-year jail sentence.  The law, which went into effect July 1, did not contain exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents or guardians. Instead, the statute dictated that biological fathers who cause the pregnancy of their daughters, if minors, couldn t pursue legal actions.  The Tennessee law mimicked the so-called   abortion trafficking   law enacted in Idaho last year, the first state to ever enact such a statute. However, a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho s version as the case moves through court.  Just before the law was poised to go into effect, Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.  Behn called the Tennessee ruling a  monumental victory for free speech and the fight for abortion rights.   This ruling doesn t just protect Tennesseans — it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,  she said.  A spokesperson for Attorney General s office, who was fighting to get the case dismissed, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday s ruling.  Trauger s decision sided with Welty and Behn s argument that the Tennessee law was  unconstitutionally vague,  specifically stressing that the word  recruits  is undefined in the statute.  Trauger also raised several First Amendment concerns in her explanation that her ruling would apply across the state, not just to Welty and Behn.   The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,  Trauger wrote.  Tennessee bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, but there are exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, and to remove a miscarriage or to save the life of the mother. Notably, doctors must use their  reasonable medical  judgment — a term that some say is too vague and can be challenged by fellow medical officials — in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury."

0,10,EL PAÍS English,DeSantis’s desperate attempts to torpedo abortion protections at the polls in Florida,,https://english.elpais.com/usa/elections/2024-09-22/desantiss-desperate-attempts-to-torpedo-abortion-protections-at-the-polls-in-florida.html,"The police knock on your door. They re investigating a possible case of fraud, they say.  Did you really sign a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot in November?   Such incidents have taken place across numerous Florida counties in recent weeks, according to testimonies published by local media and posted to social media. They are part of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis  desperate campaign against abortion rights. Such coordinated efforts are aimed at derailing a ballot initiative that would overturn a current restriction that makes having the procedure illegal, with no real exceptions, after the sixth week of pregnancy — a cut-off before many women even know that they are pregnant. DeSantis himself signed off on the restriction last year after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion. If Amendment 4 receives at least 60% of votes, abortion rights will be protected by the state constitution.  Legislation known as the Heartbeat Protection Act was approved by the Republican-controlled state Congress in April 2023 by a vote of 70-40, and went into effect on May 1 of this year. It s one of the most restrictive of such laws in the country, where the legal precedent that guaranteed national access to abortion, Roe vs. Wade, was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. States now have the power to legislate the issue. The Heartbeat Protection Act — which has become one of DeSantis s primary crusades — only allows abortion before the sixth week of pregnancy and then, only if there is proof and documentation to demonstrate that the pregnancy was due to rape, incest or human trafficking. Or, if it puts the mother s health in danger, though two doctors are required to certify this. Even in that case, medical professionals who sign off fear that they could face criminal action. In practice, today, there is no realistic means to legally carry out an abortion in Florida.  The severity of the law sparked spirited opposition, even back when it just a proposal. When it was approved, the organization Floridians Protecting Freedom began a sweeping campaign to collect signatures that would put Amendment 4 on the ballot for the November 2024 elections. After long months, they managed to collect one million signatures, 100,000 more than the number the state requires to get an initiative on the ballot. The signatures were checked over the course of eight months by an independent entity and again by the state s electoral authorities. In April, they were finally accepted and ratified by the state s Supreme Court, which is closely linked to DeSantis, who appointed five of its seven judges.  The Amendment 4 constitutional reform proposal that will be presented to voters establishes the following:  No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient s health, as determined by the patient s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.   Since the court s approval of its signatures was announced, Floridians Protecting Freedom and its ally organization have been campaigning in favor of Amendment 4. They raised $12 million in two months, according to their reports, and have been ceaselessly knocking on doors and educating voters, says spokesperson Lisa Zayas.  We are speaking with people about the risks of the ban, because we re already seeing many women who are being denied when they are most in need… And we re seeing that the majority of the public supports us. This is a non-partisan initiative, that has widespread support among Floridians.  Recent polls find that support for the right to abort and the amendment is between 55% and 69% of the state s voters, suggesting that the initiative will achieve the majority it needs to become law.  Amid this panorama, at the end of August, the executive and legislative branches of the Florida government began a series of actions attacking the amendment from different flanks. On August 21, the state s Supreme Court approved a financial impact statement that will be published alongside the amendment s text on ballots. That statement, which is substantially longer than the amendment itself, states the following:  The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida. The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time. Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.   Lauren Brenzel, who is the director of the Amendment 4 campaign, accused the authors of the financial impact statement of seeking to sow confusion and obscure the real issue that is under consideration.  Our campaign worked hard to ensure that the language of our initiative met constitutional standards and the state should meet those same standards for clarity and accuracy so voters are not misled. Any financial impact statement should be lawfully accurate, unambiguous, straightforward, clear, and transparent. This sham of a process is a reminder to Florida voters that politicians are playing dirty tricks to overcomplicate and politicize a simple administrative fix.   DeSantis s next step was creating a website on behalf of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that openly opposes Amendment 4. State law prohibits the government from using its authority and funds to influence an election or vote of its citizenry. When questioned about the website, which alleges that the amendment puts women s health in danger, DeSantis went on the defensive.  It is not electioneering. It s things that can absolutely be done through these public service announcements. And I m glad they re doing it.   Still not satisfied, the Florida State Department — which is also closely tied to the governor — announced that some 37,000 of the signatures that had been verified weeks prior were suspected of fraud. DeSantis has said that they are investigating petitions that were submitted  on behalf of dead people.  That is when they started to make home visits to confirm signatures, despite the fact that they had already been validated and the window to question signatures had long passed. As such, the objective of the visits is not clear, since it seems legally improbable that they will be able to get the amendment taken off the ballot at this point.  Lisa Zayas and the rest of the team behind the amendment sees these efforts as an intimidation campaign designed to torpedo the democratic process, but are undeterred in their mission.  Obviously, these actions and the spread of disinformation is pathetic and dramatic […] but we are firm in that what we see in all our studies, all our information, that the majority of citizens support this. We will continue educating to consolidate that support because we know we can do this,  says Zayas. However, on September 13, Floridians Protecting Freedom and the ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit against the  illegal use of public funds  to campaign against Amendment 4.  Beyond the official campaign, the government s tactics have generated multiple legal actions in response, and the Supreme Court recently permitted the fast-tracking of a case against Governor DeSantis and other officials who are accused of inappropriately using their power. The lawsuit asks for a ban on the misuse or abuse of their positions and agencies to interfere with the Amendment 4 election. Rather than dismiss the petition, judges have requested that defendants respond to its concerns by the afternoon of September 23.  All this could have a greater electoral impact on local elections, as well as those for the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, and even the presidential race. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a Florida resident and may vote for Amendment 4. In recent weeks, he has been asked on multiple occasions about his position on the issue, and his responses have been erratic. First, he said that he did not support the six-week ban, and then retracted the statement a few days later. It s not clear whether he will vote for or against the ballot initiative, nor the effect that could have on Florida and national elections.  Since Trump s political rise, Florida has become a state with a clear Republican majority after years of being one of the country s key political battlefields. Still, every time abortion rights have been the subject of a referendum, from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to the referendums in conservative and progressive states, the majority of voters have backed them. Throughout this presidential campaign, abortion has been one of the major issues of the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. So far, no one has dared to say it out loud, and polls suggest that it is highly unlikely, but in the middle of a ferocious battle that has placed the issue at the center of its debate, abortion could perhaps make Florida a swing state once again.

1,12,USA Today,Georgia’s abortion ban linked to Amber Thurman's death in ProPublica investigation: What to know,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/09/20/amber-thurman-georgia-abortion-law-propublica-investigation/75291366007/,"This story was updated to add new information.  Vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta Friday to respond to the deaths of two Georgia women linked to the state s abortion ban, according to a ProPublica investigation released this week.  Amber Thurman, 28, a nursing assistant and mother of a 6-year-old son died after doctors delayed necessary care due to Georgia s six-week abortion ban, says the story reported by Kavitha Surana. Medical providers stalled to provide care to treat the effects of a medication abortion, also known as a medical abortion, the investigation says.  After sharing Thurman s death, Surana reported a second story on another Georgia woman named Candi Miller who died as a result of not seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.   To tell their stories, ProPublica reviewed medical documents, autopsies and official state committee reports, interviewed family and loved ones, spoke with government officials and consulted medical experts, doctors from across the state and U.S. and people inside hospitals.  Here s what the ProPublica investigation found and what to know about Georgia s abortion law.  ProPublica: Amber Thurman, Candi Miller die under Georgia s abortion law  ProPublica s investigation explores the stories of two women who died after Georgia s strict abortion law went into effect in July 2022. The law bans abortions after six week of pregnancy with few exceptions.  According to ProPublica, Thurman became pregnant with twins unexpectedly in 2022 and faced roadblocks to receiving reproductive care due to the state s ban. She went to North Carolina for a medication abortion but experienced rare complications after taking the prescribed abortion pills.  Thurman became septic in the hospital due to excess tissue in her uterus that did not shed from her body, causing a serious infection. Thurman needed a dilation and curettage, or D&C, a procedure in which tissue is removed from inside the uterus. However, Georgia s ban considers a D&C a felony if performed outside of specific circumstances and could land doctors behind bars for up to 10 years.  Thurman s health deteriorated for 20 hours before doctors finally took her to surgery. By then, it was too late, ProPublica s reporting says. Her heart stopped on the table.  Thurman s death was  preventable,  according to Georgia s maternal mortality review committee, which said the hospital s delay in providing the D&C due to state law  had a large impact on her fatal outcome,  ProPublica reports.  Candi Miller was a 41-year-old Georgia woman with chronic health issues including lupus and hypertension that made carrying a pregnancy life-threatening.  Already a mother of three, Miller became pregnant in the fall of 2022. Fearing for her life, she did not want to keep the pregnancy. But she found that the exceptions to the Georgia abortion ban only applied to imminent and acute life-threatening emergencies and did not extend to chronic health conditions, even those that can become lethal in pregnancy, ProPublica reports.  Unwilling to wait until things became more dire, she opted out of going to a doctor s office for fear of legal repercussions and instead underwent abortion on her own, ordering pills online. She suffered a rare complication but was reticent to seek medical care, her family later told officials. She was found unresponsive on Nov. 12 at home.  An autopsy found fetal tissue in her uterus as a result of the incomplete abortion as well as a combination of pain pills. Her family said she had avoided seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.  The state committee also deemed her death  preventable,  reports ProPublica.  What does Georgia s abortion law say?  In Georgia, abortion is banned after six weeks with some exceptions. Georgia passed the six-week ban in November 2022, and it was upheld by the state supreme court in 2023.  The ban has some exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother up to 20 weeks. Critics say six weeks is too soon because studies have shown that women generally don t discover they are pregnant until they ve at least missed one period, around five to six weeks into gestation. Some experts and healthcare workers have criticized the law as having vague, difficult-to-interpret language and restrictive stipulations around what qualifies as an  exception.   Some of the specific language that impacted Thurman s case is explored in-depth in ProPublica s report.  Supporters commend the legislation for correcting what they saw as unconstitutional laws under Roe v. Wade. Some believe life begins at conception, meaning they feel they are protecting the life of a baby in the womb. Other supporters say that abortion was too widely and loosely used before the law went into place or that their religious beliefs compel them to support restrictions. Supporters also maintain that the exceptions outlined in the bill are ample to protect the health of mothers and babies.  The  heartbeat  law, known as the LIFE Act, has been the subject of some back-and-forth in state courts, having initially been blocked by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney who previously ruled the ban  unequivocally unconstitutional  on the grounds it was introduced in 2019 before the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  The higher court, however, determined in October of last year that the new precedent set by the reversal is now the standard by which to judge abortion-related matters in a 6-1 decision.  Responses to ProPublica s investigation  Some organizations issued statements in response to ProPublica s reporting.  Nancy Northup, President & CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights said, in part:  Amber Thurman should be alive today. Her death was preventable—her doctors knew how to perform the very basic medical procedure needed to save her life, but felt their hands were tied because of the state s abortion ban. The Georgia lawmakers who passed this ban are ultimately responsible for her death, and the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.   Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs (AAPLOG) said, in part:  Amber Thurman s tragic death, recently covered by multiple news organizations, was caused by side effects of legal abortion drugs and medical negligence, not pro-life laws. Despite taking the drugs as she was instructed and seeking timely care when she experienced complications, she still died.   What has Kamala Harris said about abortion bans?  Presidential candidate Kamala Harris responded to the ProPublica piece with a statement on social media Tuesday:   A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  she said of Thurman.  Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump s actions.   Harris will also be addressing abortion bans in a planned speech in Atlanta on Friday.  What has Donald Trump said about abortion bans?   President Trump has always supported exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which Georgia s law provides,  the Trump campaign told USA TODAY in response to the death of Thurman.  With those exceptions in place, it s unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect Amber Thurman s life.   Trump has often said he believes the issue should be left up to the states."
1,13,NPR,Harris says strict abortion laws lead to ‘predictable’ suffering for women,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23971/harris-abortion-preventable-deaths-georgia,"ATLANTA — Vice President Harris called former President Donald Trump the  architect  of a health care crisis caused by a rollback of access to abortion in various states following the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.  Speaking in Atlanta Friday, Harris called tougher abortion laws  immoral  and slammed Republicans for what she called  longstanding neglect  around maternal mortality.   These hypocrites want to start talking about,  This is in the best interest of women and children,   she said.  Well, where ve you been? ... How dare they? How dare they? Come on.   As Harris tries to capitalize on the abortion issue on the campaign trail, on Friday she referenced reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after the state s new abortion law, were deemed  preventable  by a state committee of maternal health experts.  The investigations published this week tell the stories of two women, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who died from complications related to seeking abortions in the aftermath of Georgia s strict law that effectively bans most abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.   There is a word — preventable — and there is another word: predictable,  Harris said.  And the reality is for every story here of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many of the stories we re not hearing where suffering is happening every day in our country.   Trump has touted his nomination of Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion.  Thurman and Miller died from complications that arose after their bodies failed to fully expel all of the fetal tissue after medication abortions, according to records reviewed by ProPublica. Thurman died after doctors waited more than 20 hours to treat an infection; Miller died at home without seeking medical treatment  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions,  her family told ProPublica. NPR has not independently confirmed the reporting.  Some anti-abortion groups have pushed back on the characterization of those deaths as tied to abortion laws, blaming the Biden administration s looser regulations around medication abortion instead.   Amber Thurman and Candi Miller did not die because a law denied treatment,  Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement. The group blamed the administration for lifting safety requirements when it eased access to medication abortion for the deaths, as well as a lack of sufficient medical treatment.  Republicans have also pushed back on Harris  narrative around the women s deaths, with a GOP spokesperson claiming the vice president is spreading  misinformation.    Georgia not only established clear exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, but also included providing necessary care in the event of a medical emergency,  Republican National Committee spokesperson Morgan Ackley said in a statement.  There was no reason that doctors cannot act swiftly to protect the lives of mothers.   Friday s event comes as the presidential campaign enters its final six-week stretch, with Georgia as one of the swing states likely to decide the winner and as abortion rights continues to be a motivating issue for Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters.  Harris was introduced by Dr. Keisha Reddick, a Savannah OB-GYN who said that tighter abortion restrictions in Georgia and other states are  putting women s health and lives in peril.    I see fear in my patients  eyes,  she said.  I see women who have left the state to get the care that they need, and those who are unable to do so. I watch medical students and other physicians avoid coming to our state, who are packing up their lives to move across the country in pursuit of building a life where they won t face jail time for upholding their oath.   Reddick said that has left Georgia with fewer health care providers in a state that has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.  Harris also discussed abortion during a campaign event Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. She will hold a campaign rally in Madison, Wis., later Friday."
1,14,ProPublica,"Abortion Bans Have Delayed Emergency Medical Care. In Georgia, Experts Say This Mother’s Death Was Preventable.",,https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death,"In her final hours, Amber Nicole Thurman suffered from a grave infection that her suburban Atlanta hospital was well-equipped to treat.  She d taken abortion pills and encountered a rare complication; she had not expelled all of the fetal tissue from her body. She showed up at Piedmont Henry Hospital in need of a routine procedure to clear it from her uterus, called a dilation and curettage, or D&C.  But just that summer, her state had made performing the procedure a felony, with few exceptions. Any doctor who violated the new Georgia law could be prosecuted and face up to a decade in prison.  Thurman waited in pain in a hospital bed, worried about what would happen to her 6-year-old son, as doctors monitored her infection spreading, her blood pressure sinking and her organs beginning to fail.  It took 20 hours for doctors to finally operate. By then, it was too late.  The otherwise healthy 28-year-old medical assistant, who had her sights set on nursing school, should not have died, an official state committee recently concluded.  Tasked with examining pregnancy-related deaths to improve maternal health, the experts, including 10 doctors, deemed hers  preventable  and said the hospital s delay in performing the critical procedure had a  large  impact on her fatal outcome.  Their reviews of individual patient cases are not made public. But ProPublica obtained reports that confirm that at least two women have already died after they couldn t access legal abortions and timely medical care in their state.  There are almost certainly others.  Committees like the one in Georgia, set up in each state, often operate with a two-year lag behind the cases they examine, meaning that experts are only now beginning to delve into deaths that took place after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion.  Thurman s case marks the first time an abortion-related death, officially deemed  preventable,  is coming to public light. ProPublica will share the story of the second in the coming days. We are also exploring other deaths that have not yet been reviewed but appear to be connected to abortion bans.  Doctors warned state legislators women would die if medical procedures sometimes needed to save lives became illegal.  Though Republican lawmakers who voted for state bans on abortion say the laws have exceptions to protect the  life of the mother,  medical experts cautioned that the language is not rooted in science and ignores the fast-moving realities of medicine.  The most restrictive state laws, experts predicted, would pit doctors  fears of prosecution against their patients  health needs, requiring providers to make sure their patient was inarguably on the brink of death or facing  irreversible  harm when they intervened with procedures like a D&C.   They would feel the need to wait for a higher blood pressure, wait for a higher fever — really got to justify this one — bleed a little bit more,  Dr. Melissa Kottke, an OB-GYN at Emory, warned lawmakers in 2019 during one of the hearings over Georgia s ban.  Doctors and a nurse involved in Thurman s care declined to explain their thinking and did not respond to questions from ProPublica. Communications staff from the hospital did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Georgia s Department of Public Health, which oversees the state maternal mortality review committee, said it cannot comment on ProPublica s reporting because the committee s cases are confidential and protected by federal law.  The availability of D&Cs for both abortions and routine miscarriage care helped save lives after the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, studies show, reducing the rate of maternal deaths for women of color by up to 40% the first year after abortion became legal.  But since abortion was banned or restricted in 22 states over the past two years, women in serious danger have been turned away from emergency rooms and told that they needed to be in more peril before doctors could help. Some have been forced to continue high-risk pregnancies that threatened their lives. Those whose pregnancies weren t even viable have been told they could return when they were  crashing.   Such stories have been at the center of the upcoming presidential election, during which the right to abortion is on the ballot in 10 states.  But Republican legislators have rejected small efforts to expand and clarify health exceptions — even in Georgia, which has one of the nation s highest rates of maternal mortality and where Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.  When its law went into effect in July 2022, Gov. Brian Kemp said he was  overjoyed  and believed the state had found an approach that would keep women  safe, healthy and informed.   After advocates tried to block the ban in court, arguing the law put women in danger, attorneys for the state of Georgia accused them of  hyperbolic fear mongering.   Two weeks later, Thurman was dead.  Thurman, who carried the full load of a single parent, loved being a mother. Every chance she got, she took her son to petting zoos, to pop-up museums and on planned trips, like one to a Florida beach.  The talks I have with my son are everything,  she posted on social media.  But when she learned she was pregnant with twins in the summer of 2022, she quickly decided she needed to preserve her newfound stability, her best friend, Ricaria Baker, told ProPublica. Thurman and her son had recently moved out of her family s home and into a gated apartment complex with a pool, and she was planning to enroll in nursing school.  The timing could not have been worse. On July 20, the day Georgia s law banning abortion at six weeks went into effect, her pregnancy had just passed that mark, according to records her family shared with ProPublica.  Thurman wanted a surgical abortion close to home and held out hope as advocates tried to get the ban paused in court, Baker said. But as her pregnancy progressed to its ninth week, she couldn t wait any longer. She scheduled a D&C in North Carolina, where abortion at that stage was still legal, and on Aug. 13 woke up at 4 a.m. to make the journey with her best friend.  On their drive, they hit standstill traffic, Baker said. The clinic couldn t hold Thurman s spot longer than 15 minutes — it was inundated with women from other states where bans had taken effect. Instead, a clinic employee offered Thurman a two-pill abortion regimen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, mifepristone and misoprostol. Her pregnancy was well within the standard of care for that treatment.  Getting to the clinic had required scheduling a day off from work, finding a babysitter, making up an excuse to borrow a relative s car and walking through a crowd of anti-abortion protesters. Thurman didn t want to reschedule, Baker said.  At the clinic, Thurman sat through a counseling session in which she was told how to safely take the pills and instructed to go to the emergency room if complications developed. She signed a release saying she understood. She took the first pill there and insisted on driving home before any symptoms started, Baker said. She took the second pill the next day, as directed.  Deaths due to complications from abortion pills are extremely rare. Out of nearly 6 million women who ve taken mifepristone in the U.S. since 2000, 32 deaths were reported to the FDA through 2022, regardless of whether the drug played a role. Of those, 11 patients developed sepsis. Most of the remaining cases involved intentional and accidental drug overdoses, suicide, homicide and ruptured ectopic pregnancies.  Baker and Thurman spoke every day that week. At first, there was only cramping, which Thurman expected. But days after she took the second pill, the pain increased and blood was soaking through more than one pad per hour. If she had lived nearby, the clinic in North Carolina would have performed a D&C for free as soon as she followed up, the executive director told ProPublica. But Thurman was four hours away.  On the evening of Aug. 18, Thurman vomited blood and passed out at home, according to 911 call logs. Her boyfriend called for an ambulance. Thurman arrived at Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge at 6:51 p.m.  ProPublica obtained the summary narrative of Thurman s hospital stay provided to the maternal mortality review committee, as well as the group s findings. The narrative is based on Thurman s medical records, with identifying information removed. The committee does not interview doctors involved with the case or ask hospitals to respond to its findings. ProPublica also consulted with medical experts, including members of the committee, about the timeline of events.  Within Thurman s first hours at the hospital, which says it is staffed at all hours with an OB who specializes in hospital care, it should have been clear that she was in danger, medical experts told ProPublica.  Her lower abdomen was tender, according to the summary. Her white blood cell count was critically high and her blood pressure perilously low — at one point, as Thurman got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted again and hit her head. Doctors noted a foul odor during a pelvic exam, and an ultrasound showed possible tissue in her uterus.  The standard treatment of sepsis is to start antibiotics and immediately seek and remove the source of the infection. For a septic abortion, that would include removing any remaining tissue from the uterus. One of the hospital network s own practices describes a D&C as a  fairly common, minor surgical procedure  to be used after a miscarriage to remove fetal tissue.  After assessing her at 9:38 p.m., doctors started Thurman on antibiotics and an IV drip, the summary said. The OB-GYN noted the possibility of doing a D&C the next day.  But that didn t happen the following morning, even when an OB diagnosed  acute severe sepsis.  By 5:14 a.m., Thurman was breathing rapidly and at risk of bleeding out, according to her vital signs. Even five liters of IV fluid had not moved her blood pressure out of the danger zone. Doctors escalated the antibiotics.  Instead of performing the newly criminalized procedure, they continued to gather information and dispense medicine, the summary shows.  Doctors had Thurman tested for sexually transmitted diseases and pneumonia.  They placed her on Levophed, a powerful blood pressure support that could do nothing to treat the infection and posed a new threat: The medication can constrict blood flow so much that patients could need an amputation once stabilized.  At 6:45 a.m., Thurman s blood pressure continued to dip, and she was taken to the intensive care unit.  At 7:14 a.m., doctors discussed initiating a D&C. But it still didn t happen. Two hours later, lab work indicated her organs were failing, according to experts who read her vital signs.  At 12:05 p.m., more than 17 hours after Thurman had arrived, a doctor who specializes in intensive care notified the OB-GYN that her condition was deteriorating.  Thurman was finally taken to an operating room at 2 p.m.  By then, the situation was so dire that doctors started with open abdominal surgery. They found that her bowel needed to be removed, but it was too risky to operate because not enough blood was flowing to the area — a possible complication from the blood pressure medication, an expert explained to ProPublica. The OB performed the D&C but immediately continued with a hysterectomy.  During surgery, Thurman s heart stopped.  Her mother was praying in the waiting room when one of the doctors approached.  Come walk with me,  she said.  Until she got the call from the hospital, her mother had no idea Thurman had been pregnant. She recalled her daughter s last words before she was wheeled into surgery — they had made no sense coming from a vibrant young woman who seemed to have her whole life ahead of her:   Promise me you ll take care of my son.   There is a  good chance  providing a D&C earlier could have prevented Amber Thurman s death, the maternal mortality review committee concluded.  Every state has a committee of experts who meet regularly to examine deaths that occurred during or within a year after a pregnancy. Their goal is to collect accurate data and identify the root causes of America s increasing maternal mortality rate, then translate those lessons into policy changes. Their findings and recommendations are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and their states publish an annual report, but their reviews of individual cases are never public.  Georgia s committee has 32 regular members from a variety of backgrounds, including OB-GYNs, cardiologists, mental health care providers, a medical examiner, health policy experts, community advocates and others. This summer, the committee reviewed deaths through Fall 2022, but most states have not gotten that far.  After reviewing Thurman s case, the committee highlighted Piedmont s  lack of policies/procedures in place to evacuate uterus immediately  and recommended all hospitals implement policies  to treat a septic abortion on an ongoing basis.   It is not clear from the records available why doctors waited to provide a D&C to Thurman, though the summary report shows they discussed the procedure at least twice in the hours before they finally did.  Piedmont did not have a policy to guide doctors on how to interpret the state abortion ban when Thurman arrived for care, according to two people with knowledge of internal conversations who were not authorized to speak publicly. In the months after she died, an internal task force of providers there created policies to educate staff on how to navigate the law, though they are not able to give legal advice, the sources said.  In interviews with more than three dozen OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion, ProPublica learned how difficult it is to interpret the vague and conflicting language in bans  medical exceptions — especially, the doctors said, when their judgment could be called into question under the threat of prison time.  Take the language in Georgia s supposed lifesaving exceptions.  It prohibits doctors from using any instrument  with the purpose of terminating a pregnancy.  While removing fetal tissue is not terminating a pregnancy, medically speaking, the law only specifies it s not considered an abortion to remove  a dead unborn child  that resulted from a  spontaneous abortion  defined as  naturally occurring  from a miscarriage or a stillbirth.  Thurman had told doctors her miscarriage was not spontaneous — it was the result of taking pills to terminate her pregnancy.  There is also an exception, included in most bans, to allow abortions  necessary in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.  There is no standard protocol for how providers should interpret such language, doctors said. How can they be sure a jury with no medical experience would agree that intervening was  necessary ?  ProPublica asked the governor s office on Friday to respond to cases of denied care, including the two abortion-related deaths, and whether its exceptions were adequate. Spokesperson Garrison Douglas said they were clear and gave doctors the power to act in medical emergencies. He returned to the state s previous argument, describing ProPublica s reporting as a  fear-mongering campaign.   Republican officials across the country have largely rejected calls to provide guidance.  When legislators have tried, anti-abortion groups have blocked them.  In 2023, a group of Tennessee Republicans was unable to push through a small change to the state s abortion ban, intended to give doctors greater leeway when intervening for patients facing health complications.   No one wants to tell their spouse, child or loved one that their life is not important in a medical emergency as you watch them die when they could have been saved,  said Republican Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, a nurse who sponsored the bill.  The state s main anti-abortion lobbyist, Will Brewer, vigorously opposed the change. Some pregnancy complications  work themselves out,  he told a panel of lawmakers. Doctors should be required to  pause and wait this out and see how it goes.   At some hospitals, doctors are doing just that. Doctors told ProPublica they have seen colleagues disregard the standard of care when their patients are at risk of infection and wait to see if a miscarriage completes naturally before offering a D&C.  Although no doctor has been prosecuted for violating abortion bans, the possibility looms over every case, they said, particularly outside of well-funded academic institutions that have lawyers promising criminal defense.  Doctors in public hospitals and those outside of major metro areas told ProPublica that they are often left scrambling to figure out on a case-by-case basis when they are allowed to provide D&Cs and other abortion procedures. Many fear they are taking on all of the risk alone and would not be backed up by their hospitals if a prosecutor charged them with a crime. At Catholic hospitals, they typically have to transfer patients elsewhere for care.  When they do try to provide care, it can be a challenge to find other medical staff to participate. A D&C requires an anesthesiologist, nurses, attending physicians and others. Doctors said peers have refused to participate because of their personal views or their fear of being exposed to criminal charges. Georgia law allows medical staff to refuse to participate in abortions.  Thurman s family members may never learn the exact variables that went into doctors  calculations. The hospital has not fulfilled their request for her full medical record. There was no autopsy.  For years, all Thurman s family had was a death certificate that said she died of  septic shock  and  retained products of conception  — a rare description that had previously only appeared once in Georgia death records over the last 15 years, ProPublica found. The family learned Thurman s case had been reviewed and deemed preventable from ProPublica s reporting.  The sting of Thurman s death remains extremely raw to her loved ones, who feel her absence most deeply as they watch her son grow taller and lose teeth and start school years without her.  They focus on surrounding him with love but know nothing can replace his mother.  On Monday, she would have turned 31."
1,15,The Daily Beast,"Trump Rants, ‘Women Won’t Even Think About Abortion If I Win’",,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-says-women-will-be-happy-and-great-again-if-he-wins,"Donald Trump, who has taken credit for abolishing women s constitutional right to abortion with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, vowed in a lengthy Truth Social post on Friday night to  PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE .  The Republican presidential candidate appears to be trying to strike a more moderate position on women s rights as Vice President Kamala Harris keeps hammering him on the issue of reproductive freedom.   WOMEN ARE POORER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS SAFE ON THE STREETS THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE MORE DEPRESSED AND UNHAPPY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, AND ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC AND CONFIDENT IN THE FUTURE THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO!,  he wrote on Truth Social, before saying that he will  FIX ALL OF THAT, AND FAST.    WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE!  he added.  He went on speak directly to female voters, saying  YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES, AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.   Trump said he would allow  POWERFUL EXEMPTIONS, LIKE THOSE THAT RONALD REAGAN INSISTED ON—RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER.    I WILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY WILL FINALLY BE HEALTHY, HOPEFUL, SAFE, AND SECURE. THEIR LIVES WILL BE HAPPY, BEAUTIFUL, AND GREAT AGAIN!  he concluded.  However, at the first presidential debate against Harris, Trump declined to say whether he would veto a national ban.  The Harris campaign said that Trump s vow to protect women is just a trick that they won t fall for.   Donald Trump may think he can control women and tell us what to think, but women are not stupid. Women hear his threat that we  will no longer be thinking about abortion  and know it is just his way of trying to trick people about his Project 2025 plan to ban abortion nationwide,  Harris spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.  Trump is scared out of his mind that women will vote like our freedoms and our lives are on the line this November—and he should be, because that s exactly what we will do.   On Friday, in her first speech dedicated exclusively to abortion rights since becoming the presidential nominee, Harris blamed Trump for abortion bans across the country and the deaths of two Georgia mothers, who died after being unable to access legal abortions and adequate medical care in the state.   Two women—and those are only the stories we know—here in the state of Georgia died, died, because of a Trump abortion ban,  Harris said.  The deaths of Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller were first reported earlier this week by ProPublica and occurred after Georgia enacted a six-week abortion ban.  Thurman took abortion pills to end a pregnancy in 2022 but her body failed to expel all of the fetal tissue and she developed sepsis and died during an emergency surgery.  Miller s family said she didn t visit a doctor  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions,  and so she took abortion pills, which produced a similar situation to Thurman where she developed sepsis and died."
1,16,CNN,How promises of a ‘post-Roe future’ have fallen short,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/abortion-dobbs-promises-republicans/index.html,"Weeks after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, a then-little-known Republican congressman from Louisiana introduced a short bill that proposed amending the Social Security Act to ensure child support payments be made for an  unborn child.    The Unborn Child Support Act  has gone nowhere. But the congressman has. He s Mike Johnson, now the speaker of the House. More than two years after the Dobbs decision and nearly a year into a job that gives him control over which legislation get debated and voted on, Johnson hasn t touched the bill or any of its provisions.  That s far from unique. CNN s review of dozens of pledges made and bills introduced to help mothers and children living in a post-Roe America found little action, either in Washington or in state capitals where abortion bans were quickly put in place.  Abortion remains a dominant political issue going into November up and down the ballot. But on the state level, despite much fast and thorough action to ban or limit the procedure mostly in Republican-led states, only a handful of measures have been enacted to address the aftermath of those bans. In several places where politicians have spoken at length about the need to do more to help mothers and children, like in Iowa, or where bills were introduced only to stall out, like in Missouri, any substantive laws passed related to the post-Dobbs reality have only solidified those restrictions.  Few of those new laws are about mothers during their pregnancies or after. Few address child care, for infants or beyond. Even as independent researchers find the number of births going up – as well as higher rates of maternal and infant mortality and greater economic insecurity – in states where abortions are most limited, there s been little substantive legislative action in response.   For many pro-lifers, this has just not been in their lane before. It s been,  We have Roe, how do we chip away at Roe?   said Samuel Lee, a deacon who s the director of Campaign Life Missouri, an anti-abortion group that runs pregnancy centers but also pushes for funding increases for housing, child care and other measures.  Across the country, that s led to an unlikely alliance of activists, advocates and economists across the spectrum on reproductive rights who complain that anti-abortion politicians haven t followed up with enough effort to prioritize and protect life.  Since Dobbs, seven states have had ballot initiatives on the topic, with the abortion rights position winning in each state. In November, at least 10 more initiatives aimed at restoring or protecting abortion rights will be in front of voters across the country. But those measures only address the issue of abortion itself – not what happens if the procedure is restricted.   The analogy is true of the dog finally catching the mail truck and not knowing what to do,  said Josh Brahm, the CEO of the anti-abortion Equal Rights Institute, who believes legal abortion should have never been a right that Roe recognized in the Constitution. But Brahm has also rallied an array of political, faith, academic, medical and advocacy leaders into a coalition called  Building a Post-Roe Future  that calls for more affordable health care and child care, expanded child tax credits, paid parental leave, flexible work hours and enforced pre-natal support.  In an appearance in Georgia on Friday to criticize that state s six-week abortion ban, Kamala Harris accused GOP legislators of being  hypocrites  when it comes to caring about women and families.  These hypocrites want to start talking about  This is in the best interest of women and children ?  the vice president told a somber room in Atlanta.  Well, where you been? Where you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America?   In a late Friday night post on Truth Social, former President Donald Trump wrote in all capital letters that if he wins,  WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE! YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES, AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.   The former president then read out the post at his Saturday campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina.  Scattered efforts to take action  Scattered efforts have been made toward what people like Tate Reeves – the Republican governor of Mississippi, where the Dobbs case had originated – call a  culture of life.   In Mississippi, that includes laws establishing a foster parent s bill of rights and a maximum state income tax credit of $10,000 toward adoption costs. Elsewhere, Kentucky established a Lifeline for Moms maternal psychiatry access program. In Ohio, where voters last year effectively overturned a strict 2019 ban that temporarily came into effect with Dobbs, the legislature s big move on child care was allowing breastfeeding mothers to be excused from jury duty.  Though paid parental leave has been a big topic of discussion around the country, the only states to enact such measures since Dobbs are those where abortion rights are protected.  North Carolina s 2023 ban on abortions after 12 weeks, passed via a supermajority overriding the Democratic governor s veto, included increased funding for contraceptive services, measures to reduce infant and maternal mortality, and paid maternity leave for state employees – which state Senate leader Phil Berger and other Republican legislators propelling the ban acknowledged on several occasions were specific responses to abortion rights activists  complaints that conservatives only ever focus on bans.  But in a state that sees over 120,000 births each year, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, the law provides $70 million in annually recurring funds for these and other services – which comes out to about $583 per birth – and another $15 million in one-time infusions around foster care, as well as a provision expanding the scope of what midwives can do.   It s a been a growing revelation for some legislators,  said Lee, who has testified in favor of several bills he hopes will foster conditions under which women are less likely to want or seek abortions in the first place and also have resources available to them and their children in the absence of the procedure.   It s not just about stopping abortions,  Lee said.  It s about helping women, whatever their circumstances are.   Where efforts were killed and promises didn t materialize  Because of a  trigger law  waiting on the books, Missouri s ban on abortions except to save the life of the mother kicked in only six minutes after the Dobbs decision was announced.  It s also the rare state where there has been a committed, bipartisan effort to enact laws addressing what comes next, with Republican state Rep. Brenda Shields, in 2023 and again in 2024, introducing legislation to create tax credits to pay for child care.  By Shields  numbers, the effects of such a measure would have boosted the state economy by over a billion dollars.   Children have to be in a safe, loving quality program, and we have to help provide that. It s just unaffordable for working middle-class families if we don t help,  Shields, now a grandmother but with clear memories of her own time as a working mother, said in an interview in the spring.  They are people who want to bring children into this world to love and have a family, but they also have to work to be able to do that.   Republicans supported the bill. Democrats did too. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and groups like Lee s Campaign Life Missouri were also on board. Republican Gov. Mike Parson backed the effort, as did Crystal Quade, the Democratic leader in the state House and a working mom, who has since become her party s nominee to succeed Parson.  The bill passed the state House earlier this year but floundered in the state Senate. After it collapsed in the spring, Shields told CNN she gave up and started looking for another way in.   We will have to continue as a state to address this issue. We can t just walk away and think it s going to resolve itself,  Shields said.  Around the same time, another bill did get through: The governor signed into law legislation that cut Medicaid funding to the remaining Planned Parenthood facilities in the state performing non-abortion-related health care.  The end result in Missouri is that in the two-and-a-half years since Dobbs, the only measures meant to address the fallout amount to a few million dollars  worth of legislation, including tax credits for adoption and tax exemptions for child care facilities.  To Quade, this is evidence that legislators opposed to abortion rights are not really  pro-life.    It s a shame that they have been able to take hold of a phrase that means so much for so many people,  Quade said.  When I say I m a pro-life legislator, it s because I want women to have health care and aren t sent home to bleed out because they re not close enough to death.   A few hundred miles away in Iowa, anti-abortion leaders made big promises about how they would address the consequences of Dobbs. But the most significant action was legislating around court challenges to a law that restricts abortion to as early as six weeks.  When Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the law  prohibiting and requiring certain actions relating to abortion involving the detection of a fetal heartbeat, and including effective date provisions  in July 2023, she also cited the  culture of life,  explaining that  as a pro-life governor, I will continue to promote policies designed to surround every person involved in a pregnancy with protection, love, and support.  A few months later, Iowa state House Speaker Pat Grassley said that Republicans  need to look at things like adoption,  adding that  over-the-counter (birth control) needs to be part of what we re looking at within our caucus.   In an interview earlier this year with  Iowa Press  discussing the bill passed the previous summer, Grassley said,  If we really believe in what we did in July to protect life, I think these conversations are the next step in that.   Grassley helped pass legislation in March this year that defines life as starting at conception and bestows  personhood  rights, which increase penalties for people involved in abortions by criminalizing the death of an  unborn person.   Despite those earlier statements, no bills about adoption or contraception access have passed in Iowa. Zach Wahls, a Democratic state senator in Iowa, told CNN that in his chamber, he couldn t even get a subcommittee hearing for a  right to contraception  bill he co-sponsored, arguing that anti-abortion leaders in the state  abandoned Iowa women by failing to adopt basic protections.   Neither Grassley nor Reynolds responded to requests for comment.  Action falls short of promises in Washington  Back in Washington, asked why Johnson hasn t been pushing his Unborn Child Support Act forward, spokesperson Taylor Haulsee said the speaker still supports the legislation and pointed out that Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York – to whom he transferred the bill – reintroduced it earlier this year. The same day in January, the bill was referred to the House Ways & Means Committee. No action has been taken on it since.  A spokesperson for Tenney did not respond to an inquiry about the status of the bill.  Johnson is not the only member of Congress whose actions over the past two years haven t matched the promises made in statements immediately after Dobbs.  The day Dobbs was decided, GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa said in a statement that she d  work to ensure women have access to affordable contraceptives, quality maternal care, and provide support and increase awareness to adoption services.  But a month later, she voted against the Right to Contraception Act, which would have codified the right to birth control access. Miller-Meeks  office did not respond to CNN s request for comment.  Republican Rep. Young Kim of California also voted against that legislation. In the weeks after Dobbs, she said:  As a mother of four and to three daughters, I understand how important it is for women to have access to safe birth control, and I will work to support women on all levels.   In July 2023, Kim joined Miller-Meeks in introducing another bill that would require the US Food and Drug Administration to send guidance to manufacturers on how to get oral contraceptives approved, arguing that this was the best way to both keep the medications safe and create a competitive market. That bill has gone nowhere, but in response to questions about why Kim voted against the Right to Contraception Act and what other efforts she was involved in, spokesperson Callie Strock said the congresswoman  has been working in good faith with the bill s lead sponsor, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and House leadership to find a path forward to get this bill through the legislative process.   Dave Schweikert, a seven-term congressman from Arizona, greeted Dobbs by tweeting that as someone  saved from an abortion,  he was pleased with the decision. The Republican often notes that his birth mother almost had an abortion before putting him up for adoption and that he grew up in part in the foster system and later adopted his children.  But in the two years since Dobbs, Schweikert has neither signed on as a co-sponsor of a bipartisan adoption bill that remains pending nor successfully advanced other legislation that would address the consequences of Roe being overturned. Schweikert s office did not return a request for comment on why he has not signed on or whether he is pursuing similar ends through other efforts.  In the narrowly divided Senate, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney has introduced several bills aimed at boosting help for children, including one to turn tax credits into a monthly cash benefit for families. Fellow Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has introduced his own child tax credit legislation. Neither has gone anywhere, nor have other measures, even as several proposed versions of a national abortion ban have gathered support among Republicans in Congress.  Brahm, who pulled together the  Building a Post-Roe Future  coalition, said most of the bills he has seen are  window dressing  that don t do nearly enough to make mothers feel like they would have the resources if they carried pregnancies to term – or to provide for them once those babies arrive. Brahm said he has been dismayed by how often debates have gotten tangled in accusations that mothers may try to game the system through unlikely scenarios such as alternating their years of work to claim bigger tax credits.   Can we stop nitpicking and fighting about the people who need the help the most at the time they need it the most?  Brahm said.  The decisions that some of them are making do not demonstrate they actually have compassion for these people. If they do have compassion for these people, they should do a better job showing it. "
1,17,Los Angeles Times,"Trump says if he wins, women would ‘no longer be thinking about abortion’",,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-21/trump-says-if-he-wins-women-would-no-longer-be-thinking-about-abortion,"Former President Trump returned to North Carolina on Saturday, stumping in the Southern battleground state with direct appeals to women, claiming he would be a better champion for them than Vice President Kamala Harris, who is vying to become the first female president.  Trump campaigned in Wilmington, along the state s southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president s top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about Robinson s alleged posts on a pornography website s message board. Trump did not mention Robinson during a speech that lasted just over an hour.  Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn t be forced out of the race by  salacious tabloid lies.  Trump s campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump  is focused on winning the White House and saving this country  and calling North Carolina  a vital part of that plan,  without mentioning Robinson.  Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Harris  campaign highlighting the Republican candidates  ties and Robinson s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris  campaign, it s their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a downballot race.  Both abortion rights and Robinson are electoral liabilities for Trump in a state he previously won twice. Before CNN s report, Robinson already was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state s attorney general. Polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close race here and nationally.  Trump downplays abortion as a campaign issue  In his first outdoor rally since the second apparent attempt to assassinate him, Trump argued women would be safer and more prosperous with him as president and would  no longer be thinking about abortion.    I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure,  Trump said.  Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again. So women, we love you. We re going to take care of you.   The former president said women won t have to think about abortion because decisions about regulating it are now left to the states. Many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in 2022. Trump nominated three of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe.  North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks last year, with Republicans in the state legislature overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper s veto.  Voters overwhelmingly say they trust Harris to do a better job handling abortion policy, with 55% favoring her while 27% favored Trump in a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.  Harris and Democrats running down the ballot have highlighted stories of women who faced severe medical complications or death because they didn t get proper medical care from doctors worried about the impact of abortion laws. Harris on Friday blasted Trump as a threat to women s freedoms and their lives, warning in a speech in Georgia that Republicans would continue to target access to abortion if he returns to the White House.   Trump is scared out of his mind that women will vote like our freedoms and our lives are on the line this November — and he should be, because that s exactly what we will do,  Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement after Trump s rally.  Trump also showed a gentler side, inviting two of his young grandchildren onstage. The former president lifted Carolina Trump to the microphone, where she said  Make America great again  to cheers, followed by her older brother, Luke Trump, who said,  Vote for Grandpa.  They re the children of Eric Trump, the former president s second son, and his wife, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who now serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.  Bulletproof glass surrounded Trump as he spoke, a new precaution for outdoor venues the Secret Service implemented after a bullet grazed Trump s ear during a rally in Butler, Pa.  Trump supporters dismiss the new claims against Robinson  A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns, but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That s part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall.  With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina s marquee downballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as  Martin Luther King on steroids.   Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued:  I think you re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.   Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion  weren t responsible enough to keep your skirt down  and comparing abortion to slavery.  Charlie Kimball, a 46-year-old former construction worker from Burgaw, who said he is currently on disability, dismissed the new allegations against Robinson as  fake news.    That s his personal life. Who cares?  Kimball said.  It s all hearsay.   Although the presidential contenders have made more visits to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state s importance. Following Biden s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris.  Wilmington is in New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state.  Julia Novotny, 55, of Wilmington, said she s come around to supporting Trump after initial reservations because of allegations that he s been sexually abusive to women, which he denies.   He s classy, he s a gentleman, he looks good in a suit, and he has strong values,  Novotny said.  Everybody makes mistakes, and whether he did or didn t, I don t know, but you know what? Leave him alone. He s a good man. He wants to change this country. "
1,18,PBS,Investigation links Georgia's abortion ban to preventable deaths of 2 women,,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/investigation-links-georgias-abortion-ban-to-preventable-deaths-of-2-women,"Amna Nawaz:  This fall, reproductive health care access is on the ballot in nearly a dozen states.  Meanwhile, we re now learning more about the effects of abortion restrictions enacted at the state level after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade two years ago.  John Yang reports.  John Yang:  Amna, ProPublica found at least two women in Georgia who died after being unable to get either a legal abortion or timely medical care.  Official state committees examining pregnancy-related deaths concluded that both were preventable. Georgia law says a physician can go to prison for performing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The law does have an exception to prevent the death of a pregnant woman, but physicians say there s no guidance on how to interpret that.  Kavitha Surana is the ProPublica journalist who reported this story.  Kavitha, you illustrated two aspects of this Georgia law, the first case involving Amber Nicole Thurman. She tried to get an abortion out of state, missed her appointment for a traffic jam, of all things, and so was prescribed a medication abortion. What happened to her?  Kavitha Surana, ProPublica:  Right.  And it s important to make clear that abortion medication, major medical organizations and studies have consistently found that they are safe and effective when taken appropriately. But they can cause complications.  And if complications happen, patients should go to the hospital right away and expect to receive a D&C procedure. That s the same kind of procedure that s used for both abortions and miscarriage care to remove any fetal tissue that remains.  So what we know is that Amber had complications. She went to the hospital. And doctors waited 20 hours to provide a D&C. They talked about it multiple times. They monitored her as her blood pressure fell, her organs began failing. And, ultimately, when they did intervene, it was too late to save her life.  The Maternal Mortality Review Committee reviewed this case and they agreed that it was preventable, and they said that the largest impact was the delay in receiving a D&C procedure. They said that there was a good chance, if doctors had done it sooner, that her life could have been saved.  Kavitha Surana:  We don t know what was going through the doctors  heads and the hospitals did not respond to requests for comment.  A lot of lawmakers that have passed these abortion bans, and not just Georgia s, have promised that they have exceptions for the life of the mother or medical emergencies, but they re written in ways that experts say are confusing and not rooted in science. They threaten prison time if a prosecutor decides that they re not followed correctly.  And doctors have told me that this type of threat, it can really change the dynamics of how they interact with patients. In fact, we have reported a lot of in-depth stories about this kind of delay in care where doctors have explained exactly how it changed the way that they were treating patients.  Even if they do feel like they can go ahead, sometimes, they also have to convince lawyers and nurses and other colleagues to participate who have the right in some states like Georgia not to participate in any abortion-related care.  Kavitha Surana:  Well, one of the first things that s important to know about this case is that Candi Miller, who was a 41-year-old mother of three, had a lot of medical complications. She had diabetes, lupus, and hypertension, and her doctors actually told her that it would be dangerous for her to go through another pregnancy and may even threaten her life.  And these abortion exceptions do not have any kind of exception that addresses the situation. They re really limited to emergencies, not situations where a patient s condition may become an emergency later. So, because abortion was outlawed, her family says she ordered pills online from overseas and took them at home.  Again, these pills, they can cause complications, and patients should go to the hospital if that happens. From what we know, she did experience some pain. The abortion didn t complete, according to an autopsy. And her family s understanding was that abortion was outlawed and people could go to jail for having an abortion.  That s not clear from Georgia law. Courts have ruled that women cannot be prosecuted for their own abortion, but there s been a lot of confusion around this. And candy was found with fentanyl and other medicines in her system. It s not clear why she took them or where she got them.  Kavitha Surana:  Yes, many of the Republicans who passed these laws have consistently waved off these kinds of concerns.  When we reached out to Governor Kemp s office to tell them about our reporting, they called this kind of reporting fearmongering. The thing is, it s not news or surprise that abortion bans are unclear or can cause confusion or are dangerous for women s health. Ever since they were written doctors, major medical organizations, patients who ve had these experiences themselves have been speaking up about warning that these bans are not clear and could lead to women dying unnecessarily.  And in some states, even, there s been efforts to propose small changes, the kind of changes doctors say would help them avoid situations of delayed care. But over and over again, we have seen major anti-abortion organizations oppose these changes.  Kavitha Surana:  That s why ProPublica is continuing to report on this topic. The fact that these cases happened in 2022, it s just a sign of how hard they are to track down. Often, families aren t even aware of all the circumstances.  Now, every state does have a committee that reviews maternal deaths and they look at the root causes and make some findings about them. But those committees are about two years behind and just now starting to look at cases that happened after Roe was overturned and these abortion bans came into effect.  So we have a lot of reason to believe that there are more women whose stories have been impacted by the inability to get a legal abortion in their state. And we re continuing to work on bringing them to light."
1,19,AP News,'She should be alive today' — Harris spotlights woman's death to blast abortion bans and Trump,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-election-abortion-rights-georgia-amber-thurman-5ba5dabf0dc3c98de12389c34b47475d,"ATLANTA (AP) — Kamala Harris blasted Donald Trump as a threat to women s freedoms and their very lives, warning in a speech in the battleground state of Georgia on Friday that Republicans would continue to choke off access to abortion if he returns to the White House.  The Democratic vice president s visit came days after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies.  Such deaths, Harris said, were not only preventable but predictable because of laws that have been implemented since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Although Georgia s six-week ban allows abortions in early pregnancy to save a mother s life, critics say the law has created dangerous confusion for doctors about when they re allowed to provide care.   Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die?  Harris asked.  Harris shared the story of Amber Thurman, a mother who decided to have an abortion when she became pregnant again.   She had her future all planned out,  Harris said.  And it was her plan. What she wanted to do for herself, for her son, for their future.   However, Thurman waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills. She developed sepsis and died.   She was loved,  Harris said.  And she should be alive today.   Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court s decision more than two years ago, but Friday s speech in Atlanta was her first focused squarely on the issue since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.  Harris heard Thursday night from Thurman s mother and sisters.  During a livestreamed campaign event hosted by Oprah Winfrey and attended by Harris, Shanette Williams, Thurman s mother, tearfully told viewers that  people around the world need to know that this was preventable.  Williams said she initially did not want to go public about her daughter s 2022 death but ultimately decided it was important for people to understand her daughter  was not a statistic. She was loved.   Harris told the family:  I m just so sorry. The courage you all have shown is extraordinary.   She spoke about Thurman at a second rally Friday, before a thunderous crowd of thousands in the swing state of Wisconsin. Speaking in the Democratic stronghold and state capital, Madison, she called the bans put in place in more than 20 states  immoral  and warned against another Trump term.   We are not going back,  Harris said.  Trump has repeatedly said he was proud to help overturn Roe v. Wade by appointing conservative justices during his term in office. He s also said he supports exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother.  Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump s campaign, said that since Georgia has such exceptions in place,  it s unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect the lives of mothers.   Anti-abortion advocates and doctors argued Friday that the women s deaths raise questions around the safety of taking abortion pills at home without management by a doctor. Advocates have been pushing for tougher restrictions on the pills for years, most recently at the U.S. Supreme Court in a failed attempt to limit availability.   Women think that it s completely safe for them to go online and order these drugs,  Christina Francis, a Fort Wayne, Indiana, OB-GYN who opposes abortion, told reporters Friday.  Since 2000, the FDA has approved a two-drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol as a safe way to end pregnancies through 10 weeks gestation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA eliminated an in-person visit requirement to get the drugs. Reported complications have been rare and surgical intervention to end the pregnancy is needed in 2.6% of cases.  Dozens of pregnant patients have faced delayed care or been turned away from hospitals amid medical emergencies over the last two years, a violation of federal law, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Violations occurred in states with and without abortion bans. But an AP analysis earlier this year found an immediate spike in some states with abortion bans, including Texas, following the ruling.  Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN in Georgia, said the six-week ban has caused a  massive environment of fear and confusion and uncertainty  for the medical community.  She said Republican legislators who are now blaming hospitals and doctors are seeing the ramifications of the laws playing out in real time.   The law is preventing us from being able to provide evidence-based care without having to think about the risk of criminal prosecution,  she said.  With in-person early voting starting Friday in three states — Virginia, South Dakota and Minnesota — Harris  campaign is hoping that reproductive rights will be a strong motivator for Democrats. The party points to a series of electoral wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, and advocates believe Harris is a strong messenger.  About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their votes — but it s more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About 6 in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about 4 in 10 male voters.  The gender gap doesn t stop there.  About 6 in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about 2 in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris.  ___ Long and Seitz reported from Washington.

The high court s ruling came days after it heard arguments in three lawsuits that sought to keep one or both of the competing abortion initiatives off the November ballot.  An organizer for the measure to expand abortion rights, Protect Our Rights campaign manager Allie Berry, called the decision a  victory for all Nebraskans.   Matt Heffron, an attorney with the conservative Thomas More Society, which challenged the measure to expand abortion rights, called the court s ruling  deeply concerning  and said the group fears that if the measure passes, it would lead to unnecessary abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.  One initiative would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until viability, or later to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would enshrine in the constitution Nebraska s current 12-week abortion ban, passed by the Legislature in 2023, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman.  Nebraska will be the first state to carry competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, effectively ending 50 years of national abortion rights and making abortion a state-by-state issue..  In Nebraska, voters could end up approving both competing abortion ballot measures. But because they re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most  for  votes would be the one adopted, the secretary of state s office has said.  ARIZONA  1864 abortion ban officially off the books  PHOENIX — Arizona s Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions officially was repealed on Sept. 14.  The western swing state has been whipsawed over recent months, starting with the Arizona Supreme Court deciding in April to let the state enforce the long-dormant 1864 law that criminalized all abortions except when a woman s life was jeopardized. Then state lawmakers voted on a bill to repeal that law once and for all.  Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed the bill in May, declaring it was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona.  It will be up to Arizona voters to decide whether to adopt a ballot measure in November to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.  After the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement, Hobbs urged the state legislature to take imminent action to undo the ban before it went into effect. Republican lawmakers, who hold a narrow majority in both chambers, derailed discussions about repealing the ban, but House Democrats were able to garner the support of three Republicans to pass the repeal legislation, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. Two GOP senators joined with Democrats to grant final approval.  In the weeks between the high court s decision and Hobbs signing the repeal into law, Arizonans were in a state of confusion about whether the near-total ban would end up taking effect before the repeal was implemented.  With the territorial ban no longer in play, Arizona law allows abortions until 15 weeks. After that, there is an exception to save the life of the mother, but missing are exceptions for cases of rape or incest.  Judge blocks lithium drilling opposed by tribe  A federal judge has temporarily blocked exploratory drilling for a lithium project in Arizona that tribal leaders say will harm land they have used for religious and cultural ceremonies for centuries.  Lawyers for the national environmental group Earthjustice and Colorado-based Western Mining Action Project are suing federal land managers on behalf of the Hualapai Tribe. They accuse the U.S. Bureau of Land Management of illegally approving drilling planned by an Australian mining company in the Big Sandy River Basin in northwestern Arizona, about halfway between Phoenix and Las Vegas.  U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa granted a temporary restraining order on Aug. 21 and planned to hear initial arguments for an injunction on Sept. 17.  The tribe wants the judge to issue a preliminary injunction extending the prohibition on activity at the site pending trial on allegations that federal approval of the exploratory drilling violated the National Historic Preservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act.  Arizona Lithium plans a total of 131 drilling sites across nearly a square mile to obtain samples to help determine if there s enough lithium to construct a mine and extract the critical mineral needed to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, among other things.  Justice Department lawyers representing the bureau said in court filings that the tribe is exaggerating potential harm that could come solely from exploratory drilling.  According to the lawsuit, there is archaeological evidence of the tribe s presence there dating to 600 A.D.  UTAH  Mormon s oldest-ever president turns 100  SALT LAKE CITY — Leaders of worldwide religions commonly stay at the helm well past retirement age, but it s not often you find centenarians overseeing major faiths.  That s what The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has as of Sept. 9, when church president Russell M. Nelson turned 100. He had already become the oldest president ever of the Utah-based faith three years ago and now becomes its first to hit the century mark.  On Nelson s 100th birthday, the church commemorated the occasion with a special broadcast in his honor. Also, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican and church member, declared Sept. 9 to be  President Russell M. Nelson Day  in the state.  The president of the denomination, known widely as the Mormon church, oversees everything from the its multibillion-dollar financial holdings to church doctrine and policy. He also is believed to be a prophet of God and serves until death.  By tradition, the new president is chosen from among the Quorum of The Twelve Apostles, one of the faith s top governing bodies — specifically its longest tenured member. Selected to join the Quorum in 1984, Nelson has spent four decades in the upper echelons of church leadership.  In 2018, he became the church s 17th president at 93, making him the second oldest at the time to ever assume the role.  Born in Salt Lake City in 1924, Nelson joined the religion as a young adult."
2,21,The Des Moines Register,Iowa Poll: Most Iowans oppose state's 6-week abortion ban law now in effect,,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/09/22/most-iowans-support-legal-abortion-oppose-iowas-six-week-ban-new-iowa-poll-shows-fetal-heartbeat-law/75180451007/,"(This story has been updated to change a photo selection and to clarify the definition of the  fetal heartbeat  law.)  © Copyright 2024, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.  A majority of Iowans oppose the state s new  fetal heartbeat  law, which bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, according to a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll.  The poll found that 59% of Iowans — including 69% of women — disapprove of the new restrictions. It found 37% of Iowans favor the new law, and 5% are not sure.  This latest Iowa Poll is the first test of Iowans  views on abortion since the state s six-week ban went into effect July 29.  Iowans  support for abortion rights has continued to rise since the pandemic and in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Iowa Poll results show.  Now, 64% of Iowa adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a new high since the Iowa Poll began asking the question in 2008. That compares with 33% who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases and 3% who are not sure.  This poll of 811 Iowans was conducted by Selzer & Co. from Sept. 8-11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.  The new  fetal heartbeat  law, which is among the most restrictive in the nation, prohibits abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected in a pregnancy and includes narrow exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities and to save the life of the pregnant woman.  It replaced Iowa s previous law, which allowed abortions until about 20 weeks.  The poll found widespread disapproval of the new law among many groups of Iowans, including 91% of Democrats, 88% of suburban women, 78% of those who identify with no religious group and 71% of all suburban adults.  Among the half-dozen demographic groups likely to favor the six-week ban are Republicans (67%), evangelicals (58%), fathers of children younger than 18 (54%) and residents of the 4th Congressional District, married men and white men with college degrees (each at 50%).  GOP-controlled Legislature passes 6-week ban in 2023; court gives green light this year  Iowa s hotly contested abortion ban was passed by the Republican-majority Iowa Legislature in a marathon one-day special session last year. The law was blocked by a legal challenge until earlier this year, when the Iowa Supreme Court ordered an injunction on the ban to be lifted.  More than two in three Iowa women (69%) oppose the law, compared with 27% who favor the ban. Four percent are not sure.  Tiara Soupene, a 27-year-old poll respondent from Tiffin, is among those who oppose the abortion ban. As a nurse who cares for women in pregnancy, she said cutting off access to abortion care would mean more women put at risk.   I know the outcome,  said Soupene, a self-identified Democrat.  I know how easily an ectopic pregnancy can rupture, and then you can go septic or you can bleed to death.   Soupene is also a trained sexual assault nurse examiner who handles rape kits for women after they ve been sexually assaulted. Even with the new ban s exceptions, she fears that those who become pregnant won t be able to get abortion care because they ll be unable to prove the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.   I m worried we ll get to the point where people will say,  Well, how do you know that for sure? Where really is the proof?   she said.  Attitudes toward Iowa s new abortion law are closely split among Iowa men, with 48% opposing the law. 46% in favor and 6% who are unsure.  Poll respondent Eric May, a 63-year-old Cedar Rapids resident and self-identified Republican, supports Iowa s six-week ban.  May, an evangelical, says he believes abortion is murder in any circumstances and does not support any exceptions. Although he said he would like to see a law that bans abortion at conception, May believes Iowa s current law is the  best we can attain today under the political environment we re in.    This was fought tooth and nail to get where we re at today,  said May, who works as a telecommunications technician.  Even if with the strong majorities (in the Iowa Legislature) that we currently have that got the six-week ban into place, getting a ban closer to conception is going to be very difficult.   Support for legal abortion continues to grow among Iowans  The 64% of Iowans who support legal abortion includes 25% who say it should be legal in all cases and 39% who say it should be legal in most cases.  By comparison, the 33% of Iowans who oppose abortion includes 26% who say it should be illegal in most cases and 7% who say it should be illegal in all cases; 3% are not sure.  The Iowa Poll has measured Iowans  views on abortion seven times since September 2018, and once before in 2008, with the latest findings showing the highest support.  In a March 2023 Iowa Poll, the most recent test of this issue, 61% of Iowans said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 35% said it should be illegal in most or all cases.  Poll respondent Jessa Bears, a 38-year-old farmer living in Farragut, is an abortion rights supporter who said she believes the government shouldn t have a say in a person s decision to seek the procedure.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, nearly two-dozen states have enacted greater restrictions on abortion. Bears, a self-identified Democrat, said watching these laws be passed has been  terrifying.   Bears worries that Iowa s law could exacerbate challenges to recruit health care providers for rural communities, which already face a severe shortage of maternity care. She said her community has an emergency room, but if she needs care from an urgent care clinic or a specialty physician, she must drive at least an hour away.   There s just so many gray areas in medical decisions that to have these black-and-white laws just make no sense to me,  she said.  You paint it with a broad brush, and it s going to cause problems — a lot more problems than I think they even realize when they re passing the dang law.   Support for legal abortion is heavily split among party lines, with 92% of Democrats saying they support abortion in all or most cases and 7% saying abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.  By comparison, a majority of Republicans, 63%, say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Thirty-two percent say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.  Independents, by contrast, are much more supportive of abortion rights, with 70% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases and 26% saying it should be illegal in all or most cases.  Corey Baldwin, a 51-year-old poll respondent living in Ridgeway, is a self-identified Republican who believes abortion should be illegal in most cases. He said he believes abortion should be restricted to certain circumstances, such as rape, incest or to preserve the life of the pregnant woman.  However, Baldwin s thoughts on Iowa s six-week ban are complicated.  The self-employed truck driver has four daughters, and he agrees most women likely wouldn t know they are pregnant before six weeks. But he said he doesn t agree that abortions should take place much later in pregnancy.   Maybe six weeks is too short,  Baldwin said.  It s a tough topic. There s pros and cons on both sides, but my biggest thing is that I just don t think (abortion) should be used as birth control.   Iowa Supreme Court s approval rating tied to Iowans  abortion views  The Iowa Poll also tested Iowans  opinions of the Iowa Supreme Court, which cleared the way for the state s abortion ban to go into effect earlier this year.  About half, 49%, of poll respondents say they approve of the state Supreme Court, while 33% disapprove and 18% are not sure.  The latest poll shows Iowans  views on abortion are tied to their approval of the justices.  Sixty-nine percent of those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases say they approve of the state s top court. Fourteen percent say they disapprove, and 18% are not sure.  A plurality of those who support legal abortion disapprove of the Iowa Supreme Court (44%), while 39% approve and 17% of that group are not sure.  May, the poll respondent from Cedar Rapids, said he approves of the Iowa Supreme Court primarily because of its recent ruling on the six-week abortion ban.   I am in favor of what they re currently doing, and the fact that they did allow it to go through,  May said.  Bears, the poll respondent from Farragut, disapproves of the Iowa Supreme Court, saying she believes the justices were  playing politics  in allowing Iowa s stricter abortion law to go into effect.   It happened relatively quickly after the federal Supreme Court ruling, so I feel it was already loaded in the cannon, ready to pull the trigger as soon as they had the means. Then, boom, it was done,  she said.  These new findings on the court s job performance show little change from July 2022, the last time the Iowa Poll tested this issue. At that time, 48% of Iowans approved of the court, while 28% disapproved.  In the February 2019 Iowa Poll, 59% of Iowans approved of the state Supreme Court, while 14% disapproved.

About the Iowa Poll  The Iowa Poll, conducted Sept. 8-11, 2024, for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 811 Iowans ages 18 or older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.  Questions based on the sample of 811 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents—such as by gender or age—have a larger margin of error.

Such coordinated efforts are aimed at derailing a ballot initiative that would overturn a current restriction that makes having the procedure illegal, with no real exceptions, after the sixth week of pregnancy — a cut-off before many women even know that they are pregnant. DeSantis himself signed off on the restriction last year after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion. If Amendment 4 receives at least 60% of votes, abortion rights will be protected by the state constitution.  Legislation known as the Heartbeat Protection Act was approved by the Republican-controlled state Congress in April 2023 by a vote of 70-40, and went into effect on May 1 of this year. It s one of the most restrictive of such laws in the country, where the legal precedent that guaranteed national access to abortion, Roe vs. Wade, was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. States now have the power to legislate the issue. The Heartbeat Protection Act — which has become one of DeSantis s primary crusades — only allows abortion before the sixth week of pregnancy and then, only if there is proof and documentation to demonstrate that the pregnancy was due to rape, incest or human trafficking. Or, if it puts the mother s health in danger, though two doctors are required to certify this. Even in that case, medical professionals who sign off fear that they could face criminal action. In practice, today, there is no realistic means to legally carry out an abortion in Florida.  The severity of the law sparked spirited opposition, even back when it just a proposal. When it was approved, the organization Floridians Protecting Freedom began a sweeping campaign to collect signatures that would put Amendment 4 on the ballot for the November 2024 elections. After long months, they managed to collect one million signatures, 100,000 more than the number the state requires to get an initiative on the ballot. The signatures were checked over the course of eight months by an independent entity and again by the state s electoral authorities. In April, they were finally accepted and ratified by the state s Supreme Court, which is closely linked to DeSantis, who appointed five of its seven judges.  The Amendment 4 constitutional reform proposal that will be presented to voters establishes the following:  No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient s health, as determined by the patient s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.   Since the court s approval of its signatures was announced, Floridians Protecting Freedom and its ally organization have been campaigning in favor of Amendment 4. They raised $12 million in two months, according to their reports, and have been ceaselessly knocking on doors and educating voters, says spokesperson Lisa Zayas.  We are speaking with people about the risks of the ban, because we re already seeing many women who are being denied when they are most in need… And we re seeing that the majority of the public supports us. This is a non-partisan initiative, that has widespread support among Floridians.  Recent polls find that support for the right to abort and the amendment is between 55% and 69% of the state s voters, suggesting that the initiative will achieve the majority it needs to become law.  Amid this panorama, at the end of August, the executive and legislative branches of the Florida government began a series of actions attacking the amendment from different flanks. On August 21, the state s Supreme Court approved a financial impact statement that will be published alongside the amendment s text on ballots. That statement, which is substantially longer than the amendment itself, states the following:  The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida. The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time. Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.   Lauren Brenzel, who is the director of the Amendment 4 campaign, accused the authors of the financial impact statement of seeking to sow confusion and obscure the real issue that is under consideration.  Our campaign worked hard to ensure that the language of our initiative met constitutional standards and the state should meet those same standards for clarity and accuracy so voters are not misled. Any financial impact statement should be lawfully accurate, unambiguous, straightforward, clear, and transparent. This sham of a process is a reminder to Florida voters that politicians are playing dirty tricks to overcomplicate and politicize a simple administrative fix.   DeSantis s next step was creating a website on behalf of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that openly opposes Amendment 4. State law prohibits the government from using its authority and funds to influence an election or vote of its citizenry. When questioned about the website, which alleges that the amendment puts women s health in danger, DeSantis went on the defensive.  It is not electioneering. It s things that can absolutely be done through these public service announcements. And I m glad they re doing it.   Still not satisfied, the Florida State Department — which is also closely tied to the governor — announced that some 37,000 of the signatures that had been verified weeks prior were suspected of fraud. DeSantis has said that they are investigating petitions that were submitted  on behalf of dead people.  That is when they started to make home visits to confirm signatures, despite the fact that they had already been validated and the window to question signatures had long passed. As such, the objective of the visits is not clear, since it seems legally improbable that they will be able to get the amendment taken off the ballot at this point.  Lisa Zayas and the rest of the team behind the amendment sees these efforts as an intimidation campaign designed to torpedo the democratic process, but are undeterred in their mission.  Obviously, these actions and the spread of disinformation is pathetic and dramatic […] but we are firm in that what we see in all our studies, all our information, that the majority of citizens support this. We will continue educating to consolidate that support because we know we can do this,  says Zayas. However, on September 13, Floridians Protecting Freedom and the ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit against the  illegal use of public funds  to campaign against Amendment 4.  Beyond the official campaign, the government s tactics have generated multiple legal actions in response, and the Supreme Court recently permitted the fast-tracking of a case against Governor DeSantis and other officials who are accused of inappropriately using their power. The lawsuit asks for a ban on the misuse or abuse of their positions and agencies to interfere with the Amendment 4 election. Rather than dismiss the petition, judges have requested that defendants respond to its concerns by the afternoon of September 23.  All this could have a greater electoral impact on local elections, as well as those for the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, and even the presidential race. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a Florida resident and may vote for Amendment 4. In recent weeks, he has been asked on multiple occasions about his position on the issue, and his responses have been erratic. First, he said that he did not support the six-week ban, and then retracted the statement a few days later. It s not clear whether he will vote for or against the ballot initiative, nor the effect that could have on Florida and national elections.  Since Trump s political rise, Florida has become a state with a clear Republican majority after years of being one of the country s key political battlefields. Still, every time abortion rights have been the subject of a referendum, from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to the referendums in conservative and progressive states, the majority of voters have backed them. Throughout this presidential campaign, abortion has been one of the major issues of the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. So far, no one has dared to say it out loud, and polls suggest that it is highly unlikely, but in the middle of a ferocious battle that has placed the issue at the center of its debate, abortion could perhaps make Florida a swing state once again.

2,23,Politico,DeSantis deploys government resources to fight Florida abortion amendment,,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/desantis-florida-abortion-amendment-government-resources-00180054,"TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida Republican leaders have repeatedly tapped into taxpayer-funded resources to fight a November ballot initiative that would overturn the state s six-week abortion ban.  Their repeated efforts — from a state-run website attacking the amendment to election police questioning signers of the petition to get the measure on the ballot — have drawn them into a protracted legal fight with the campaign behind the initiative, which will appear before voters as Amendment 4.  It is an escalation of government overreach, amendment supporters say, as part of an all-out effort by Republicans to protect the six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed into law while he was preparing to run for president. They charge that the state government is violating the law — while DeSantis and his allies strenuously defend their actions as merely educating the public and protecting Floridians.   What we are witnessing is a disturbing pattern of government interference — not only in women s healthcare but also in the very democratic process itself,  ACLU of Florida spokesperson Keisha Mulfort wrote in an email.  This authoritarian overreach is deeply dangerous and has real, life-threatening consequences for women across Florida.   The sides will square off in court soon on one of those fronts. The ACLU of Florida and the Southern Legal Counsel asked a Leon County Circuit Court judge to shut down a website posted by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration — which regulates the state s 50 licensed abortion clinics — claiming the initiative, if approved by voters in November, would expose women and children to health risks.  Amendment 4 would abolish the state s ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, and proponents of the measure believe it would bring Florida back to standards established under Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court struck down more than two years ago.  DeSantis argues Amendment 4 would wipe out dozens of state abortion regulations, including a provision allowing only doctors to perform abortions, and others limiting late-term procedures and requiring parental consent for minors. He also said the language of the measure is broad and ambiguously written, leaving the courts effectively in charge of establishing laws rather than the Legislature.   Why would you want to take power away from the people of the state to determine their own destiny and transfer it to members of the judiciary?  DeSantis said during a Monday radio talk show in Fort Myers hosted by outgoing Republican state Rep. Spencer Roach.  It just doesn t make any sense to do it.   A spokesperson for DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Proponents of the amendment have dismissed DeSantis  charges as distractions trying to scare voters.   If you don t want to talk about an abortion ban that has no real exceptions, that is criminally harming women, you talk about distractions,  Lauren Brenzel, the campaign director in support of the amendment, said on a call with reporters last week.  As for the AHCA website, DeSantis said the agency regularly publishes public service announcements that inform residents about changes to laws and rules. The agency also joined up with the Florida Association of Broadcasters to release 30-second advertisements highlighting the state s current abortion laws, although it s not clear if — or where — the PSAs may have aired.  In addition, a special state police force, created by DeSantis two years ago, began investigating claims that some of the more than 891,000 voter-signed petitions that qualified the measure for the ballot were fraudulent. The Tampa Bay Times and others reported that law enforcement had shown up at some voters  homes to question them about the validity of their signatures on the petitions.  The state Democratic Party has asked for a criminal investigation into the AHCA website. It is also facing another lawsuit, which was filed by a South Florida lawyer with the state Supreme Court. The complaint accuses DeSantis, state Attorney General Ashley Moody and AHCA Secretary Jason Weida of abusing state powers to fight Amendment 4. The high court has expedited the case, asking lawyers from the state to respond by Sept. 23.  The legal fight over Amendment 4 began when Moody, a Republican, recommended that the state Supreme Court reject the abortion initiative for the ballot. The court — which is made up of a majority of DeSantis  appointees — denied Moody s request in April, clearing Amendment 4 for the November election.  Amendment supporters and Florida Republicans have also clashed over a financial statement that will be placed next to the measure on the ballot. Lawyers from Moody s office fought a lawsuit seeking to force a revision to the statement and lost. While that was under appeal, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and House Speaker Paul Renner, both Republicans, voluntarily called for the panel of economists who craft the statement to convene and review a statement that had been published before the six-week abortion ban took effect.  But rather than summon a meeting of the same group of mostly apolitical budget experts who initially drafted the financial statement last year, before the six-week ban went into effect, Renner replaced a House finance committee staff director with a research fellow from the right-leaning and anti-abortion Heritage Foundation. DeSantis chose to send his longtime budget adviser, who brought in an anti-abortion professor from the Catholic University of America as an adviser.  The resulting financial statement tells voters that Amendment 4 may force the state to pay for abortions through Medicaid and lead to an economic downturn and higher regulatory costs. Those points were among the revisions that were requested by the DeSantis budget adviser and the Heritage research fellow before the updated financial statement was finalized this summer.  The Florida Supreme Court subsequently denied a request made by the Amendment 4 campaign to reject the revised statement.   That provides some clarity when a voter sees that,  DeSantis said of the financial statement during a discussion earlier this month at a church in Tallahassee.  That is not a partisan organization providing that information, that is going to be on the ballot that you actually read.   Amendment 4 will share the ballot with GOP presidential nominee and Florida registered voter Donald Trump, who announced in late August that he will vote against Amendment 4. The amendment will need at least 60 percent of the vote in order to pass, which means it will need plenty of support from GOP voters.  But rather than actively campaign against the measure, like DeSantis, Trump has tried to distance himself from his adopted home state s abortion policies. He says he opposes the six-week ban and pilloried DeSantis for it when the two were primary rivals. And he demurred when asked if he would support a national abortion ban during a recent debate with Kamala Harris.  DeSantis has complained that not enough Republicans have spoken publicly against the abortion initiative. During the Monday talk show with Roach, he said many are failing promises they made as candidates.   You have this amendment, which is the one that would make Florida one of the most radical abortion jurisdictions in the world, and yet you have people that won t even say that they re going to vote no on it,  DeSantis said.  Forget about actually putting in some sweat to say this shouldn t be in the constitution — actually going out and doing something about it.    They won t even say that,  DeSantis said."
2,24,ProPublica,"Afraid to Seek Care Amid Georgia’s Abortion Ban, She Stayed at Home and Died",,https://www.propublica.org/article/candi-miller-abortion-ban-death-georgia,"Candi Miller s health was so fragile, doctors warned having another baby could kill her.   They said it was going to be more painful and her body may not be able to withstand it,  her sister, Turiya Tomlin-Randall, told ProPublica.  But when the mother of three realized she had unintentionally gotten pregnant in the fall of 2022, Georgia s new abortion ban gave her no choice. Although it made exceptions for acute, life-threatening emergencies, it didn t account for chronic conditions, even those known to present lethal risks later in pregnancy.  At 41, Miller had lupus, diabetes and hypertension and didn t want to wait until the situation became dire. So she avoided doctors and navigated an abortion on her own — a path many health experts feared would increase risks when women in America lost the constitutional right to obtain legal, medically supervised abortions.  Miller ordered abortion pills online, but she did not expel all the fetal tissue and would need a dilation and curettage procedure to clear it from her uterus and stave off sepsis, a grave and painful infection. In many states, this care, known as a D&C, is routine for both abortions and miscarriages. In Georgia, performing it had recently been made a felony, with few exceptions.  Her teenage son watched her suffer for days after she took the pills, bedridden and moaning. In the early hours of Nov. 12, 2022, her husband found her unresponsive in bed, her 3-year-old daughter at her side.  An autopsy found unexpelled fetal tissue, confirming that the abortion had not fully completed. It also found a lethal combination of painkillers, including the dangerous opioid fentanyl. Miller had no history of drug use, the medical records state; her family has no idea how she obtained them or what was going through her mind — whether she was trying to quell the pain, complete the abortion or end her life. A medical examiner was unable to determine the manner of death.  Her family later told a coroner she hadn t visited a doctor  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.   When a state committee of experts in maternal health, including 10 doctors, reviewed her case this year at the end of August, they immediately decided it was  preventable  and blamed the state s abortion ban, according to members who spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity.  They came to that conclusion after weighing the entire chain of events, from Miller s underlying health conditions, to her decision to manage her abortion alone, to her reticence to seek medical care.  The fact that she felt that she had to make these decisions, that she didn t have adequate choices here in Georgia, we felt that definitely influenced her case,  one committee member told ProPublica.  She s absolutely responding to this legislation.   This is the second preventable death related to abortion bans that ProPublica is reporting this week. Amber Thurman, 28, languished in a suburban Atlanta hospital for 20 hours before doctors performed a D&C to treat sepsis that resulted from an incomplete abortion. It was too late.  This young mother should be alive, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  Vice President Kamala Harris said of Thurman on Tuesday.  This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.   There are almost certainly other deaths related to abortion access. Georgia s committee, tasked with examining pregnancy-related deaths to improve maternal health, has only reviewed cases through fall 2022. Such a lag is common in these committees, which are set up in each state; most others have not even gotten that far.  The details of their reviews are not shared with the public, but ProPublica obtained the Georgia committee s summary report of Miller s death. ProPublica also reviewed death records and Miller s autopsy and spoke to her family.  Her case adds to mounting evidence that exceptions to abortion bans do not, as billed, protect the  life of the mother.  Harrowing stories about denied care have been at the center of the upcoming presidential election, during which the right to abortion is on the ballot in 10 states. ProPublica s new reporting makes clear, for the first time, that in the wake of bans, women are losing their lives in ways that experts have deemed preventable.  It also underscores the reality that abortion bans have not actually led to a decrease in abortions. But for people like Miller, they have increased the degree of difficulty and risk.  No Health Exceptions  Miller grew up in Alabama and spent most of her adulthood in Atlanta, where she made a living braiding hair and doing nails. She had a soft spot for stray cats, nurtured a garden and was known to break into dance at the sound of old school funk like the Commodores. At 4 foot 9, she was a  firecracker,  her family said — quick to stand up for those she loved. That included her three kids, who range in age from 5 to 16.  But about eight years ago, she was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks healthy tissue, her sister said. Symptoms include extreme fatigue; painful, swollen joints; heart complications; and kidney disease.  Miller experienced flare-ups of debilitating pain for which she had to seek radiation treatments. She often wasn t able to stand for long periods and her hair fell out. It distressed her how often doctors dismissed her pain; she grew to doubt they could give her help when she needed it.  Soon after she was diagnosed, she suffered a major depressive episode, Tomlin-Randall said. For months, she barely left her bed. Tomlin-Randall cared for her sister s children during that time.  There is no cure for lupus, but patients can manage symptoms with a mixture of drugs and therapies; 90% of those afflicted are women, and the condition is three times more common in Black women than white.  Miller also had diabetes and hypertension. Those conditions, layered on top of her lupus, can be dangerously exacerbated by pregnancy and are highly unpredictable, during both the pregnancy and the aftermath, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Patients with those conditions are also more likely to have a pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or premature birth and are more likely to need a cesarean section, a major surgery that is especially hard for patients with diabetes to recover from.  With support, some patients can remain stable and have healthy pregnancies, though the experience can be physically taxing and painful. In the worst cases, pregnancy with lupus can lead to high blood pressure that can quickly progress to seizures, kidney and liver dysfunction and, ultimately, death. Studies have found the maternal death rate for women with lupus is 20-fold higher than for those without lupus. The chance of relapses and flare-ups are also high in the postpartum period.  Each patient s situation is different and needs careful evaluation of their particular health risks, including discussion of the option to end the pregnancy, said Dr. Sarah Horvath, an OB-GYN representing ACOG.  Politicians who support abortion bans often point to their exceptions, which they say protect  the life of the mother.  During last week s debate, former President Donald Trump called them  very important.   But the anti-abortion groups that drafted the bans wrote the exceptions to be as narrow as possible and persuaded lawmakers to impose steep criminal penalties, fearing doctors might stretch definitions to create loopholes.  The exceptions are limited to acute emergencies, usually defined as when  necessary in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.  They also specifically prohibit mental health reasons from counting as health emergencies, even if a pregnant woman says she is thinking about harming herself. In Georgia, violating the law can cost doctors their license and subject them to prison terms of up to 10 years.  The laws typically don t include any leeway for intervening earlier to treat patients with broader health risks that could make pregnancy more dangerous, such as lupus.  ProPublica surveyed dozens of doctors in nine states with abortion bans. None of their hospitals approve abortions for women with high-risk complications like lupus or diabetes unless the patient is already deteriorating and the issue is urgent.  Horvath regularly sees patients with complications from those conditions in Pennsylvania because they can t get care in their own state. Often, the delay in figuring out where to go means their pregnancy is further along — and, as a result, their conditions have become more dangerous. They show up to outpatient clinics already displaying signs of trouble, Horvath said, and immediately have to be sent to the hospital where there s an operating room and a blood bank.  It often takes time for patients and their providers to coordinate care in other states because there is so much confusion about the laws.   People who are really suffering in these pregnancies really don t know where to go,  Horvath said.  Or if they even can.   An Unsupervised Alternative  Miller s third pregnancy was difficult and she never fully recovered, Tomlin-Randall said.  When Miller learned she was pregnant again in 2022, she ordered abortion pills for about $80 from a website called AidAccess, according to her 16-year-old son, Christian Cardenas.  The organization, based in the Netherlands, is devoted to expanding abortion access to places where it is not legal. Patients contact a doctor in Europe who sends them pills from a supplier in India. According to one researcher, Aid Access serves about 7,000 patients a month in the U.S., nearly 90% of them in states with abortion bans or severe restrictions. Its founder, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, said it was clear the abortion pill did not cause her death.  The committee also did not believe Miller s death was caused by the abortion medication. Her autopsy found extremely high doses of diphenhydramine (the main ingredient in Benadryl) and acetaminophen (what s found in Tylenol) in Miller s system, along with the fentanyl. Considering the quantity of drugs and the timing of her death, the committee also did not suspect the abortion pills themselves were in any way tainted.  Self-managing abortions at home has skyrocketed since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, because of access to pills that can be ordered online, researchers say.  Major studies, the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization have found abortion pills to be more than 90% effective when taken correctly and in the first trimester. Deaths due to abortion pills are exceedingly rare. Complications can develop if some fetal tissue remains in the uterus, where it can lead to sepsis, a grave infection. Patients are supposed to follow up with a doctor to make sure the abortion has fully completed and go to the hospital if bleeding heavily or exhibiting other symptoms.  Miller s family does not know how far along her pregnancy was when she took the abortion pills.  But soon enough, she was in excruciating pain.  And that s how she remained, for days, until she took the potent drug mixture. Her family doesn t know what she was thinking when she did it, but can t fathom that she would want to end her life; she was excited about the future and drawing closer to her church, her sister Tomlin-Randall said.   She was trying to terminate the pregnancy, not terminate herself,  she said.  It was significant to the state maternal mortality review committee that Miller did not feel she could seek medical care.  Although Georgia courts have said women can t be prosecuted for getting abortions, the state has sent mixed messages. While some state bans explicitly say women can t be prosecuted, Georgia s ban leaves open that possibility. In 2019, a district attorney on the outskirts of metro Atlanta called abortion  murder  and said women  should prepare for the chance that they could be criminally prosecuted for having an abortion.   That was the understanding in Miller s family.   If you get caught trying to do anything to get rid of the baby,  her son Christian told ProPublica,  you get jail time for that. "
2,25,NPR,"Abortion providers — and patients — are on the move, as state laws keep shifting : Shots - Health News",,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5114359/abortion-rates-guttmacher-planned-parenthood-ban-states,"Soon after a series of state laws left a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Mo., unable to provide abortions in 2018, it shipped some of its equipment to states where abortion remained accessible.  Recovery chairs, surgical equipment and lighting from the Missouri clinic — all expensive and perfectly good — could still be useful to other health centers run by the same affiliate, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in its three other states. Much of it went to Oklahoma, where the organization was expanding, CEO Emily Wales said.  When Oklahoma banned abortion a few years later, it was time for that equipment to move again. Some likely ended up in Kansas, Wales said, where her group has opened two new clinics within just over two years because abortion access there is protected in the state constitution — and demand is soaring.  Her Kansas clinics regularly see patients from Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Louisiana, as Kansas is now the nearest place to get a legal abortion for many people in the Southern United States.  Like the shuffling of equipment, America s abortion patients are traveling around the nation to navigate the patchwork of laws created by the Supreme Court s Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization decision, which left policies on abortion to the states.  Since that ruling, 14 states have enacted bans with few exceptions, while other states have limited access. But states that do not have an abortion ban in place have seen an 11% increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a national nonprofit that supports abortion rights. Over 170,000 people traveled out of their own state to receive abortion care in 2023, according to the institute.  Not all of the increase in abortions comes from interstate travel. Telehealth has made medication abortions easier to obtain without traveling. The number of self-managed abortions, including those done with the medication mifepristone, has risen.  And Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said the majority of the overall abortion increase in recent years came from in-state residents in places without total bans, as resources expanded to improve access.   That speaks, in a lot of ways, to the way in which abortion access really wasn t perfect pre-Dobbs,  Maddow-Zimet said.  There were a lot of obstacles to getting care, and one of the biggest ones was cost.   Last year, the estimated number of abortions provided in the U.S. rose to over 1 million, the highest number in a decade, according to the institute.  Still, abortion opponents hailed an estimated drop in the procedure in the 14 states with near-total bans.   It s encouraging that pro-life states continue to show massive declines in their in-state abortion totals, with a drop of over 200,000 abortions since Dobbs,  Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wrote in a statement.  Organizations in states where abortion remains legal feel the ripples of every new ban almost instantly. One Planned Parenthood affiliate with a clinic in southern Illinois, for example, reported a roughly 10% increase in call volume in the two weeks following the enactment of Florida s six-week abortion ban in May. And an Illinois-based abortion fund, Midwest Access Coalition, experienced a similar pattern the day the Dobbs decision was announced in June 2022.   Our hotline was insane,  said Alison Dreith, the coalition s director of strategic partnerships.  People didn t know what the decision meant for their ability to access abortion, Dreith said, including whether already scheduled appointments would still happen. The coalition helps people travel for abortions throughout 12 Midwestern states, four of which now have total bans with few exceptions.  After serving 800 people in 2021, the Midwest Access Coalition went on to help 1,620 in 2022 and 1,795 in 2023. Some of that increase can be attributed to the natural growth of the organization, which is only about a decade old, Dreith said, but it s also a testament to its work. It pays for any mode of transportation that will get clients to a clinic, including partnering with another Illinois nonprofit with volunteer pilots who fly patients across state lines on private flights to get abortions.   We also book and pay for hotel rooms,  Dreith said.  We give cash for food and for child care.   The National Network of Abortion Funds, a coalition of groups that offer logistical and financial assistance to people seeking abortions, said that donations increased after the Dobbs decision and that its members reported a 39% increase in requests for help in the following year. They financially supported 102,855 people that year, including both in-state and out-of-state patients, but they have also seen a  staggering drop off  in donations since then.  Increased awareness about the options for abortion care, spurred on by an increase in news stories about abortion since the Dobbs decision, may have fueled the rise in abortions overall, Maddow-Zimet said.  Both sides now await the next round of policy decisions on abortion, which voters will make in November. Ballot initiatives in at least 10 states could enshrine abortion rights, expanding access to abortions, including in two states with comprehensive bans.   Lives will be lost with the elimination of laws that protect more than 52,000 unborn children annually,  wrote Pritchard, of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, citing an analysis on the group s website.  In the meantime, Wales said her clinics in Kansas don t have enough appointments to accommodate everyone who reaches out about scheduling an abortion. In the early days after the Dobbs decision, Wales estimated, only 20% of people who called the clinic were able to schedule an abortion appointment.  The organization has expanded and renovated its facilities across the state, including in Wichita, Overland Park and Kansas City, Kansas. Its newest clinic opened in August in Pittsburg, just 30 miles from Oklahoma. But even with all that extra capacity, Wales said her group still expects to be able to schedule only just over 50% of people who inquire.   We ve done what we can to increase appointments,  Wales said.  But it hasn t replaced what were many states providing care to their local communities. "
2,26,CNN,"Safety issues with medication abortion are extremely rare, experts emphasize",,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/medication-abortion-safety/index.html,"Two Georgia mothers, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, died in 2022 because of a lack of care most likely tied to the state s abortion ban, the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica reported this week. Both experienced complications after taking abortion medications, the reporting said — complications, doctors emphasized, that are exceedingly rare and entirely treatable.   To read about a mom just trying to make the best decisions for herself and her family die from something completely preventable in the United States – I don t think  tragedy  is a strong enough word,  said Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, an obstetrician/gynecologist and founder of Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas.  According to the report, Thurman received abortion medication from a clinic in North Carolina shortly after abortion was banned after six weeks in her home state of Georgia, and she went to her local hospital with a severe infection days later, after her body didn t expel all of the fetal tissue.   There should not have been a second of waiting  for her to receive care, Moayedi told CNN.  She should have immediately been taken for a uterine aspiration,  a procedure that removes the contents of the uterus, performed for both abortion and miscarriage care.  Instead, ProPublica reported, Thurman didn t receive surgical care to remove the fetal tissue for 20 hours. The report said it s not clear from Thurman s records why doctors waited so long, but noted the procedure had been criminalized just weeks before by the state s abortion ban, after the US Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade that summer. Thurman s heart stopped during surgery, the outlet reported, after she d been diagnosed at the hospital with acute severe sepsis and went into organ failure.  According to a second report, Miller didn t seek care at a hospital at all, even — as her son told ProPublica — she was bedridden with pain for days after taking medication abortion pills. A report from the Clayton County medical examiner, obtained by CNN, cited a conversation with her husband in which he indicated that she  did not go to an ob/gyn due to the current legislations on pregnancies and abortions.   Miller too hadn t expelled all the fetal tissue, ProPublica reported, and she should have had a dilation and curettage, or D&C, procedure to remove it and avoid infection. Her autopsy report, obtained by CNN, showed that she died from a combination of medications, including the painkillers fentanyl and acetaminophen; the medical examiner s report noted that she didn t have a history of illicit drug use.  Georgia s Department of Public Health told CNN that the reports of its maternal mortality review committee are confidential. ProPublica, which cited unnamed sources, including members of the committee, noted that those reports deemed Thurman and Miller s deaths  preventable  and, in Miller s case, tied to the state s abortion law.  The reports have enflamed the political debate over access to abortion, with Vice President Kamala Harris saying this week that  this is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.  Harris will visit Georgia on Friday to deliver further remarks on women s reproductive rights.  Abortion rights opponents blamed Thurman s doctors for not providing immediate care – and blamed medication abortion itself.  But researchers who study medication abortion and doctors who prescribe it emphasized to CNN that the regimen is safe and offered guidance for what patients should do if they experience rare complications.  How does medication abortion work?  Medication abortion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2000 and is currently cleared to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks of gestation.  Data shows that it s now the most common way people in the US access abortion, making up about two-thirds of the approximately 1 million abortions in the formal health-care system in the US last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.  It consists of two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue, and is taken first. It s followed a day or two later by misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract, leading to cramping and bleeding, during which the pregnancy tissue is expelled.  The process, Moayedi explained, is  physiologically really the same  as a miscarriage.  How common are complications?  Serious adverse events with medication abortion happen less than 0.5% of the time, according to Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) program at the University of California, San Francisco. Those adverse events can include hospitalization, blood transfusions and surgery, he said.  Retaining pregnancy tissue and requiring vacuum aspiration happens for 3% to 5% of people who have a medication abortion, Grossman noted, but it s not considered a serious complication and is typically managed in an outpatient setting; Moayedi said retained pregnancy tissue rarely leads to infection.  Deaths after medication abortion are very rare too, Grossman noted: There were 32 reported among people using mifepristone between 2000 and 2022, a time when approximately 5.9 million women used the medicine. He said his team reviewed the causes reported to the FDA, and almost half were probably not related to the abortion.   I have cared for thousands upon thousands of people with medication abortion,  said Moayedi, whose clinic provides  wraparound  care, seeing people before or after abortion in Texas, where abortions are illegal with rare exceptions.  I can count on my one hand — less than one hand — the number that have had an infection afterwards. So this is exceedingly rare.   Rare particularly, Moayedi said, because women  could immediately seek help  if they experienced a problem — something she worries, as the ProPublica reporting suggests, may be less accessible in states with abortion bans.  What should patients do if they experience complications?  Signs of complications include fever, severe abdominal pain and bleeding that soaks through more than two menstrual pads an hour for two hours, Moayedi said. Grossman added that feeling very weak or having nausea, vomiting or diarrhea more than a day after taking the last pill can also be a sign of an infection.  He advises people experiencing any worrisome symptoms to try to reach the clinic or service that provided the medications, or to call the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline at 1-833-246-2632; it s a free hotline staffed by clinicians to answer questions and provide support.   But if a patient is experiencing one of the symptoms mentioned above and they cannot talk with a clinician by phone,  Grossman said,  they should go to an emergency department.   What about patients in states with abortion bans?  People experiencing these complications can — and should — legally receive care for them anywhere, even in states that have abortion bans, doctors told CNN, so they shouldn t hesitate to go to a hospital for emergency care.  But the onus can t be only on the patient to ensure that they get care, Moayedi emphasized; hospital systems need to ensure that they understand the laws and have plans in place that enable physicians to provide necessary treatment, she said.  Grossman also pointed out that  the same complications that occur with medication abortion can also occur with miscarriage, and the treatment is the same.    I would never advise a patient to lie, but I am very concerned about these reports that patients  care is being delayed in states with abortion bans when they present with complications after an abortion — even though the law should not apply to these cases,  he said, noting that his team has heard through its research about similar delays in care for other patients.  The doctors can treat the patient presenting with bleeding or an infection without knowing whether the patient took medications or not.   He said he advises clinicians not to ask patients whether they took medications to end their pregnancies,  since it doesn t affect their care, and instead may just increase legal risks for the patients.

2,27,CBS News,"Harris speaks about abortion in Georgia, highlighting deaths of two Georgia women",,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-abortion-georgia-deaths-two-georgia-women/,"Atlanta – Vice President Kamala Harris  visit to Georgia Friday is centered around one thing: women s reproductive rights.  The visit by Harris follows ProPublica s investigation into two women who recently died in the state. It found their deaths could have been prevented, but their medical care was hindered by Georgia s six-week abortion ban. Harris highlighted the stories of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman, the two women at the center of ProPublica s report, and argued cases like theirs would intensify if former President Donald Trump is reelected.  According to ProPublica, Thurman, who was pregnant, took abortion pills, but did not expel all of the fetal tissue from her body, a rare complication. She needed a routine dilation and curettage to remove the tissue, but the procedure was now a felony in Georgia. A doctor who performed the procedure could be prosecuted and sentenced to prison. ProPublica reported that doctors monitored  her infection spreading, her blood pressure sinking and her organs beginning to fail.  By the time they operated, it was too late.  Harris hammered Trump over his support for abortion ban with an exception to save the life of the mother.   Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action,  Harris said,  You know, the other folks, Trump and his running mate? They re talking about,  Yeah, I do believe in an exception to save a mother s life.  Okay, let s break that down shall we? So, we are saying that we re going to create public policy that says that a doctor, a health care provider, will only kick in to give the care that somebody needs if they re about to die? Think about what we are saying right now. You re saying good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy, is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die?   Thurman s family met with Harris at her  Unite for America  rally Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. On Friday, Harris talked about her conversation with Thurman s mother and sisters. She said they told her about  how terribly they miss her.    Their pain is heartbreaking,  Harris said. She added that Thurman s mother said that she  can t stop thinking  about the word  preventable  because  medical experts have now determined that Amber s death was preventable.  Harris also said she promised Thurman s mother she d make sure her daughter is not remembered  just as a statistic.   In Michigan Thursday, Harris reminded voters that  Trump chose three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would [undo] the protections of Roe v Wade, and they did as he intended.   Anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America accused Harris of attempting to use these stories to  score political points.    We mourn the senseless loss of Amber, Candi, and their unborn children. We agree their deaths were preventable. But let s be absolutely clear: Georgia s law and every pro-life state law calls on doctors to act in circumstances just like theirs. If abortion advocates weren t spreading misinformation and confusion to score political points, it s possible the outcome would have been different,  said Katie Daniel, the group s state policy director.  In Atlanta, Harris also called out Trump s plans to vote as a Florida citizen against a state ballot measure that would protect abortion rights and restore the limits set under Roe v. Wade. Like Georgia, Florida has a six-week abortion ban in place.   And now, Donald Trump says he will personally cast his vote in Florida, which is where he now lives, to support their extreme abortion ban, just like the one that is here in Georgia,  she said.  Asked about his vote during the September debate between Harris and Trump, Trump falsely claimed Democratic-run states and Harris  running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, support abortion in the ninth month, and argued there was wide bipartisan support for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.   [Abortion access is] the vote of the people now. It s not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it,  he said during the debate.  And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.   One Harris campaign official said its work in Georgia has focused on tying reproductive rights to the state s Black maternal mortality rate.  Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates for Black women according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Both Thurman and Miller were black.  This is Harris  third trip to the state as a presidential candidate, and her eighth this year as vice president, according to a CBS News tracker.  A number of her trips have been focused on women s reproductive rights. Surrogates for the campaign are currently on a  Reproductive Freedom Tour  that began in Florida and is passing through the swing states. Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has traveled to states that were imposing abortion restrictions or bans, such as Arizona, Indiana and Iowa.  In March, she became the first vice president to visit an abortion provider when she made a trip to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota."
2,28,Yahoo News,Trump Says Women 'Will No Longer Be Thinking About Abortion' If He Wins,,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-says-women-no-longer-213202564.html,"Former President Donald Trump doubled down over the weekend on a bizarre all-caps message to female voters that he posted to his Truth Social page late Friday:  YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION.   He repeated the message nearly word-for-word during a rally Saturday afternoon in Wilmington, North Carolina, suggesting that women will no longer need to concern themselves with their reproductive rights under a second Trump term ― even as recent polls show his support flagging among women.   Let s talk about our great women, because women have gone through a lot,  Trump said, after he d been speaking for around an hour.  He cited no evidence as he claimed women are now  more stressed and depressed,  less healthy, poorer and less safe than they were four years ago.   I will fix all of that, women, I will fix all of that. And at long last, this national nightmare that we re going through will be over. Women will be happy,  Trump said onstage.  He added, as he did on Truth Social, that if he wins,  You will no longer be thinking about abortion.   But then his message became confused.  Trump gestured to his role in abolishing nationwide abortion rights in favor of allowing each state to enact their own laws, which is what happened when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The lack of nationwide protections, however, has led some states to pursue extreme bans with very limited exceptions, leaving individual patients with slim or no options.  Trump suggested he supports  POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS  for rape and incest, even though he has no sway over state-level abortion laws and has refused to clarify his position on implementing a nationwide abortion policy of any kind.  The Supreme Court s demolition of Roe v. Wade has proved overwhelmingly unpopular, although he has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that the move was actually popular.  According to a New York Times/Siena College poll last month, an increasing share of voters in swing states are saying abortion access is their top policy concern. That puts Trump, who has bragged about appointing the conservative Supreme Court justices that helped tip the scales in favor of repealing Roe, in a difficult spot.  Trump also repeated another regular lie at his rally about Democratic lawmakers wanting to  execute  newborns or  demanding  abortion late in pregnancy.  The suggestions are wholly without basis in fact. Abortion late in pregnancy is exceedingly rare; it is sometimes chosen in circumstances where a fetus develops a condition incompatible with life. It is not legal anywhere in the U.S. to intentionally kill an infant.  Related..."
2,29,AP News,Two Georgia deaths are tied to abortion restrictions. Experts say abortion pills they took are safe,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-georgia-mifepristone-misoprostol-kamala-harris-fd3c817f42ccc74b04d12450efb92f4a,"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak about abortion Friday in Georgia, where two women s deaths have been tied to a state law that mostly bans the procedure after roughly six weeks.  Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat complications that occurred after she took abortion pills. Reported by ProPublica earlier this week, the case is the first publicly reported instance of a woman dying from delayed care tied to a state abortion law.  The news organization also reported on the death of Candi Miller, a woman with lupus, diabetes and hypertension who took abortion pills she ordered online. An autopsy found fetal tissue that hadn t been expelled and a lethal combination of painkillers, ProPublica reported. The state s maternal mortality review committee did not believe abortion medication caused her death.  Still, the fact both women used the pills — mifepristone and misoprostol — may raise questions about whether they are safe. Here are some facts.  What safety limits have been imposed?  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 as a safe and effective way to end early pregnancies. The drug, which blocks the hormone progesterone, also primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of another drug typically used along with it, misoprostol. The pills are used in more than six in 10 abortions nationally.  There are rare occasions when mifepristone can cause excessive bleeding that requires emergency care.  Because of that, the FDA initially imposed strict safety limits on who could prescribe and distribute it — only specially certified physicians and only as part of three mandatory in-person appointments with the patient getting the drug. The doctors also had to be capable of performing emergency surgery to stop excess bleeding and an abortion procedure if the drug didn t end the pregnancy.  Over the years, the FDA reaffirmed mifepristone s safety and repeatedly eased restrictions, culminating in a 2021 decision doing away with any in-person requirements and allowing the pill to be sent through the mail.  In 2022, a coalition of anti-abortion groups filed a federal lawsuit against the FDA challenging the agency s long-standing approval of mifepristone. Justices ruled in June that the abortion opponents lacked the legal right to sue and preserved access to the medication.  How often are there serious problems?  Abortion opponents say the more lax restrictions resulted in many more  emergency complications.  But that argument lumps together women experiencing a range of issues with mifepristone — from the drug not working to people who may simply have questions or concerns but don t require medical care.  OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer  major  or  serious  adverse events after taking mifepristone.  A legal brief by a group of medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says:  When used in medication abortion, major adverse events — significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization — occur in less than 0.32% of patients, according to a highly regarded study with more than 50,000 patients.   The definition that scientists generally use for serious adverse events includes blood transfusions, major surgery, hospital admissions and death, said Ushma Upadhyay, one of the authors of that 2015 study.  The prescribing information included in the packaging for mifepristone tablets lists slightly different statistics for what it calls  serious adverse reactions.  It cites ranges for how frequently various complications occur: 0.03% to 0.5% for transfusion; 0.2% for sepsis and 0.04% to 0.6% for hospitalization related to medication abortions. The ranges reflect findings across various relevant studies, experts said.  Why do patients go to the emergency room?  Mifepristone s labeling also lists a complication that most medical groups don t consider a serious or major adverse event: ER visits, which ranged from 2.9% to 4.6%. The current FDA label lists going to the ER as an option if patients experience prolonged heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain or a sustained fever.  But ER visits don t always reflect big problems, doctors told The Associated Press.  Some people may go there after a medication abortion because they want to be checked out or have questions but don t have a doctor, said Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Others, she said,  don t want to go to their primary care provider about their abortion  because of stigma.  A study she co-authored in 2018 found that slightly more than half of patients who visited the ER because of abortions received only observational care. Some, Upadhyay said,  don t receive any treatment.   How effective is the medication?  Mifepristone results in a completed abortion 97.4% of the time, according to U.S. studies cited in the FDA label.  But in 2.6% of cases, a surgical intervention is needed. And 0.7% of the time, the pregnancy continues.  That s compared to a procedural abortion in a clinic, where the chance of the procedure failing to end a pregnancy  is extremely, extremely low,  probably less than 0.1%, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, a board member for the college of OB-GYNs.   Any time a procedural abortion is done, the clinicians ensure that it was a complete abortion  by examining the tissue that is removed or performing an ultrasound during or after the procedure, she said.  Gupta, who has done abortion procedures for more than 20 years, said there are  very few complications from abortion — any kind of abortion, medication or procedural abortion.  A recent study suggests that s just as true for medication abortions that happen in a clinic, a doctor s office or at home with the help of telehealth.  How does mifepristone s safety and effectiveness compare to other drugs?  The FDA makes drug approval decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing effectiveness, safety and other factors.  No drug is 100% effective, and many common medications don t work for a significant portion of patients.  Antidepressants typically help between 40% and 60% of people with depression. New antibiotics approved by the FDA often resolve about 70% of infections.  Since 2000, roughly 6 million patients have taken mifepristone, according to the FDA. A 2021 review of agency records looking for deaths that were likely related to the drug identified 13, or .00027% of patients.  Medical organizations supporting mifepristone s availability say the drug s safety — given the rate of deaths — compares to  ibuprofen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day.   ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Science and Educational Media Group.

2,30,Baltimore Sun,Nuns sue New York over abortion coverage mandate,,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/09/22/nuns-sue-new-york-over-abortion-coverage-mandate/,"A group of New York nuns are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to block New York regulation requiring faith-based organizations to cover abortions in their employee health insurance plans.  In a filing Tuesday, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York joined a coalition of Anglican and Catholic nuns, churches and faith-based social ministries in petitioning justices to take up a case challenging a New York State Department of Financial Services  policy that they argue violates their religious beliefs and constitutional rights. The 2017 rule prohibits insurers from excluding coverage for medically necessary abortions.   New York s abortion mandate is so extreme that not even Jesus, Mother Teresa, or Mahatma Gandhi would qualify for an exemption,  said Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit legal group that has signed onto the legal challenge.  The Justices should exempt religious organizations once and for all so they can focus on caring for the most vulnerable.   The nuns initially filed a lawsuit in 2017 challenging the law, claiming that New York initially promised to exempt employers with religious exemptions from the abortion mandate but narrowed the exemption to cover only religious groups that both primarily teach religion.  That meant that many faith-based organizations, like the Sisterhood of Saint Mary, would still be forced to cover abortion care regardless of their religious views.  New York courts rejected the legal challenge, but the religious groups asked the Supreme Court to take their case. In 2021, the Supreme Court reversed unfavorable rulings from New York courts and told them to reconsider the case in response to a landmark victory in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which held the city discriminated against a Catholic group for refusing to work with the organization over its opposition to same-sex couples.  In May, the New York Court of Appeals found that the rule did not violate religious employers  freedom because both the rule and its religious exemption were neutral and generally applicable to all employers.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the New York courts are ignoring the high court s directive stemming from the Fulton decision and are now asking the justices to overturn the regulations.   Religious groups in New York should not be required to provide insurance coverage that violates their deeply held religious beliefs,  attorney Noel J. Francisco said in a statement.  We are asking the Court to protect religious freedom and make clear that the mandate cannot be applied to this diverse group of religious organizations.   A spokesperson for the state Financial Services Department, named the primary defendant in the legal challenge, didn t immediately respond to a request for comment.  In the petition to the high court, the plaintiffs told justices the case is an opportunity to  protect religious liberty  but also  resolve a persistent split about when laws burdening religious exercise trigger strict scrutiny.  They argue that allowing certain religious conduct  for preferred subsets of religious groups  but forbidding others  is a particularly pernicious form of discrimination under the First Amendment.    No one would reasonably say a law is generally applicable if it exempts a religious nursing home that serves only Lutherans, but not one that serves indigent elderly of all faiths,  they wrote.  But that is precisely the position adopted by the New York courts.   If justices agree to take up the legal fight, it would be heard in the court s new term, which begins next month."

3,32,AP News,Republicans are trying a new approach to abortion in the race for Congress,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-reproductive-rights-harris-trump-congress-bf0da946328ab06f122a99d696c04774,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the most contested races for control of the U.S. House, many Republican candidates are speaking up about women s rights to abortion access and reproductive care in new and surprising ways, a deliberate shift for a GOP blindsided by some political ramifications of the post-Roe v. Wade era.  Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care.  In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said,  There can be no place for extremism in women s health care.   In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows,  I have always supported women s access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.   And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says,  I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.   It s a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women s lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions.  The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans  campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP s failure to grasp the political power of women s reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters.   The Republicans have always known they re actually on the wrong side of this issue,  said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party s shift  wouldn t surprise me.   With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women s access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades.  On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it s best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He s also distanced himself from the far right s longtime goal of a national abortion ban.  With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party s ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president s ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer:  We are not going back.   The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration.  Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years.  Voters didn t always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement s push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November s promised  red wave  of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority.  By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That s an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision.  In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares:  I m pro-choice.   Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars  lying about Republican candidates  positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.    Republicans can t let Democrats lie any longer — they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.   Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views — past and present.   Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,  said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats.  House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars  worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races.  Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris  example.  Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed,  We ll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.   Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions.  Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — a historic accomplishment — during the former president s term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority.  First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans.  One of the nation s leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide.  But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue.  Voters have a right to know where I stand,  Lawler said.  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report."
3,33,The Hill,Florida warns physicians abortions must be given ‘at any stage’ to save life and health,,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4889458-florida-health-officials-abortion/,"Florida health officials told physicians Thursday that abortion is permitted  at any stage in pregnancy  to save the life and health of the mother, and regulatory action will be taken against any providers who don t offer that care.  In a notice to providers, the Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) said Florida  requires life-saving medical care to a mother without delay when necessary.   The agencies said a physician providing life-saving treatment for pregnant women  does not violate Florida law and that failure to do so may constitute malpractice.   They said the alert was issued  to address misinformation currently being spread concerning Florida s abortion laws.    Providers are reminded that Florida requires life-saving medical care to a mother without delay when necessary, and the Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Department of Health will take regulatory action when a provider fails to follow this standard of care,  the agencies said.  Florida bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks. Anyone who performs an illegal abortion could be charged with a third-degree felony punishable with up to five years in prison, a $5,000 fine and loss of their medical license.  The notice was published after a report from Physicians for Human Rights said the ban created an  unworkable legal landscape.   The ban includes exceptions in cases of rape, incest and human trafficking up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. It also allows physicians to terminate a pregnancy if necessary to save the life of the mother or prevent  a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment.   According to the health agencies, the exceptions allow treatment, including abortions, for women who experience premature rupture of membranes, or ectopic or molar pregnancies.  Exceptions also exist up to 15 weeks for pregnancies resulting from rape, incest or human trafficking.  But doctors in states with abortion bans across the country have said the exceptions to such bans are often unclear and contradictory.  Health care providers say state abortion laws contain too much uncertainty and don t protect them if they need to perform an abortion. As a result, stories about pregnant patients in medical distress being turned away from hospitals or being told to wait in a parking lot until their life is in danger are becoming common.  In a press call Wednesday hosted by Floridians Protecting Freedom, the group backing Florida s ballot measure to restore abortion rights, four physicians from across the state described how difficult it has been to navigate the law s exceptions.

3,34,The Guardian,Harris condemns Trump in Georgia after news of abortion-related deaths,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-harris-election-abortion-georgia,"In her first speech dedicated exclusively to abortion rights since becoming the presidential nominee, Kamala Harris spoke on Friday afternoon in Atlanta, Georgia, blaming Donald Trump for the abortion bans that now blanket much of the United States.  Harris spoke days after news broke that two Georgia mothers died after being unable to access legal abortions and adequate medical care in the state.   Two women – and those are only the stories we know – here in the state of Georgia, died, died, because of a Trump abortion ban,  Harris said. She repeatedly referred to  Trump abortion bans  in the speech.   Suffering is happening every day in our country,  Harris continued.  To those women, to those families – I say on behalf on what I believe we all say, we see you and you are not alone and we are all here standing with you.   In the weeks since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, Harris has made reproductive rights a central part of her campaign. She has toured the country to highlight the healthcare consequences of the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, which paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions.  On Friday, Harris blamed the former president for Roe s demise because Trump appointed three of the supreme court justices who overturned the landmark decision. She also also condemned Republicans for repeatedly blocking Senate bills that would have guaranteed a federal right to in vitro fertilization, a popular fertility treatment that had its future cast into doubt after Roe s overturning.   On the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don t have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy,  Harris said.  On the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their parents they don t have the freedom to start a family.   The raucous crowd grumbled loudly at Harris s words.  Make it make sense!  someone shouted.  Although Joe Biden won Georgia in the 2020 presidential election, becoming the first Democrat in decades to take the state, Democrats seemed unlikely to recapture it until Harris replaced Biden as nominee. Now, Georgia is once again a swing state. Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina and a major Trump surrogate, has said that Trump must win Georgia if he wants to win the White House. Meanwhile, Harris in August embarked on a two-day bus tour of the state and giving her first major network interview there.  The deaths of the Georgia mothers, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, were first reported earlier this week by ProPublica and occurred after Georgia enacted a six-week abortion ban. Georgia s maternal mortality review committee looked at both women s cases and deemed their deaths  preventable , according to ProPublica.  Although Georgia permits abortions in medical emergencies, doctors across the country have said that abortion exceptions are worded so vaguely as to be unworkable. Instead, doctors have said, they are forced to watch until patients get sick enough to legally intervene.  After Thurman took abortion pills to end a pregnancy in 2022, her body failed to expel all of the fetal tissue – a rare but potentially devastating complication. Doctors delayed giving the 28-year-old a routine procedure for 20 hours, and she developed sepsis. Her heart stopped during an emergency surgery.   Under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed,  Harris said on Friday.  Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action.   Harris met with Thurman s mother and sisters on Thursday night.  Their pain is heartbreaking,  she said.  While on the campaign trail, Trump has alternated between bragging about helping to demolish Roe, complaining about how Republicans  hardline anti-abortion stances have cost the Republican elections, and flip-flopping on his own position on the procedure."

Trump recognized a number of Republicans while completely sidestepping any mention of Robinson during his rhetoric-and-racism-filled rally, which included his typical unsubstantiated rants that migrants are ruining our country, this time claiming they are  attacking villages and cities throughout the Midwest  and that  every job  created in the U.S. in the last two years has gone to migrants. He also touched on his obsessions with crowd size, saying this one went back  as far as the eye can see  to open the rally and later denying that he and J.D. Vance are  weird.   He said women will be better off should he be reelected, claiming  Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be, with the states,  despite 63 percent of U.S. adults in a Pew Research Center survey saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases. He also made the unsubstantiated claim that Democrats are demanding  execution of a baby after birth, which is what they want.   His claim was eloquently refuted earlier in the month during his debate with Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Yet, he added on Saturday,  I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe, and secure. Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again.   Trending  Meanwhile, as abortion has been in the hand of states, a disinformation campaign against a ballot measure to restore abortion rights in Florida has taken hold as providers say the state s abortion ban has doctors afraid to do their jobs and is putting patients at risk.  Trump s rally comes ahead of running mate J.D. Vance s appearance as a special guest of the Tucker Carlson Live show in Hershey, Pennsylvania also on Saturday. Trump s next rally will be held in Indiana, Pennsylvania on Monday."
3,36,WFLA,Battleground Florida: Abortion amendment,,https://www.wfla.com/news/battleground-florida/battleground-florida-abortion-amendment/,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Voters will decide this November whether to toss out Florida s six-week abortion ban.  Ahead of the vote, WFLA s Sunday morning political show, Battleground Florida, takes a deep dive into both sides of the debate.  Moderator Ty Russell spoke to Christina Diamond, CEO of Ruth s List Florida, and John Stemberger, President of Liberty Counsel Action, about Amendment 4.  The ballot summary is as follows:   No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary  to protect the patient s health, as determined by the patient s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.   The financial impact statement that will accompany this amendment:   The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida. The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time. Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.

3,37,Los Angeles Times,Federal judge temporarily blocks Tennessee’s ‘abortion trafficking’ law,,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-21/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-tennessees-abortion-trafficking-law,"A federal judge Friday temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing a law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission.  In a 49-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger argued that the Republican-controlled state cannot  make it a crime to communicate freely  about legal abortion options even in a state where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy except for a handful of situations. Trauger s decision means that the law will be placed on hold as the case make its way through court.   The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is  abortion trafficking,  the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,  Trauger wrote.  Earlier this year, Tennessee s Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on a proposal making it illegal for an adult who  intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports  a pregnant child or teen within the state to get an abortion without consent from the minor s parents or guardians. Those convicted of breaking the law risked being charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires a nearly one-year jail sentence.  The law, which went into effect July 1, did not contain exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents or guardians. Instead, the statute dictated that biological fathers who cause the pregnancy of their daughters, if minors, couldn t pursue legal actions.  The Tennessee law mimicked the so-called  abortion trafficking  law enacted in Idaho last year, the first state to ever enact such a statute. However, a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho s version as the case moves through court.  Just before the law was poised to go into effect, Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court s decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.  Behn called the Tennessee ruling a  monumental victory for free speech and the fight for abortion rights.   This ruling doesn t just protect Tennesseans — it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,  she said.  A spokesperson for attorney general s office, which was fighting to get the case dismissed, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  Trauger s decision sided with Welty and Behn s argument that the Tennessee law was  unconstitutionally vague,  specifically stressing that the word  recruits  is undefined in the statute.  Trauger also raised several 1st Amendment concerns in her explanation that her ruling would apply across the state.   The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,  Trauger wrote.  Tennessee bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, but there are exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, and to remove a miscarriage or to save the life of the mother. Notably, doctors must use their  reasonable medical  judgment — a term that some say is too vague and can be challenged by fellow medical officials — in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury.  A group of women is suing in a separate case to clarify the state s abortion ban. A court decision is expected soon on whether the lawsuit can continue or if Tennessee s abortion ban can be placed on hold as the legal battle continues."
3,38,SiouxlandProud,A lawsuit challenging a South Dakota abortion rights measure will play out after the election,,https://www.siouxlandproud.com/news/south-dakota-news/a-lawsuit-challenging-a-south-dakota-abortion-rights-measure-will-play-out-after-the-election/,"An anti-abortion group s lawsuit to invalidate an abortion rights measure appearing on South Dakota s statewide ballot won t be resolved until after the November election.  Media reports of an apparent disconnect between attorneys and the Second Judicial Circuit over scheduling of the trial — initially set for Sept. 23-27 — led the court to issue an advisory with a timeline of judge assignments in the case. A hearing on the Life Defense Fund s motion for summary judgment is now set for Dec. 2, weeks after the Nov. 5 election.  The release describes how, over about two weeks, the case was reassigned from Judge John Pekas after he learned of his wife s need for surgery. However, the case then was assigned back to him after another judge was removed from the case.  In a statement, Life Defense Fund spokesperson Caroline Woods said both parties were surprised the trial was not going to happen next week.   After an immense amount of preparation, Life Defense Fund is deeply disappointed that we are not allowed to provide our evidence to the court,  she said.  Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said,  I think for us the bottom line is that through this whole process and just trying to stop the voters of South Dakota from weighing in, and they ve been unsuccessful every step of the way, and now their hope was to have a trial during the height of the election, and that s not going to happen. … We re going to have a vote, not a trial.   Life Defense Fund alleged a mix of wrongdoing by petition circulators in its effort to kill the measure, which would place abortion rights in the state constitution.  South Dakota outlaws abortion as a felony crime, with the only exception to save the life of the mother, under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
3,39,Missouri Independent,"Missouri Supreme Court voted 4-3 to keep abortion on ballot, newly released opinions show",,https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/20/missouri-supreme-court-opinions-amendment-3-abortion/,"The decision to keep a constitutional amendment legalizing abortion on the November statewide ballot was decided by a narrowly-divided Missouri Supreme Court, according to opinions released Friday.  The majority opinion was written by Judge Paul Wilson, with Chief Justice Mary Russell, Judge Robin Ransom and Judge Brent Powell concurring.  The dissent was authored by Judge Kelly Broniec, with Judge Zel Fisher and Judge Ginger Gooch concurring in the dissent.  Amendment 3, if approved by a simple majority, would legalize abortion up until the point of fetal viability and protect other reproductive rights, including birth control. Abortion is illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for victims or rape or incest.  The Supreme Court, while divided, made one point clear in both the majority and dissenting opinions:  this case is not about abortion.    It concerns only what information the constitution requires proponents to include on any initiative petition,  Wilson wrote in the majority opinion.  It is about form and procedure, not substance.   Wilson was appointed to the court by then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. Russell was appointed by former Democratic Gov. Robert Holden. Powell was appointed by former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, and Ransom was appointed by current Republican Gov. Mike Parson  Broniec and Gooch were appointed by Parson, and Fisher was appointed by Republican Gov. Matt Blunt.  Both Gooch and Broniec are up for retention elections this year.  The initial case stemmed from a lawsuit filed in late August by a group of anti-abortion lawmakers and activists claiming the initiative petition that was later certified and approved as an amendment, failed to follow a number of laws.  This includes a section of state law requiring initiative petitions  include all sections of existing law or of the constitution which would be repealed by the measure.   The plaintiffs — state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, state Rep. Hannah Kelly, anti-abortion activist Kathy Forck and shelter operator Marguerite Forrest — sued Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft arguing the initiative petition failed to state any laws that would be repealed if it passed.  Attorneys for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the campaign behind the ballot measure, have said the amendment would not repeal the state s current abortion law or take it off the books. Instead, they told the courts, it would create a new law that would supersede much of the existing one because not every element of the current law would be rendered moot, including laws protecting women who get abortions from prosecution.  They also argued anything that falls under the scope of the amendment would be left to the judicial system to interpret and not truly repealed just in the amendment s passing.  More than 800 Missouri medical professionals sign letter in support of abortion amendment  A majority of the Supreme Court ruled that interpreting the law to require listing every possible provision that could be impacted by an amendment would have  absurd effects.    It seems reasonable to expect that few – if any – initiative petitions could survive under such a statute,  Wilson wrote.  He added that to interpret the statute as such would be unconstitutional because it would impede citizens  right to the initiative petition process.   In fact,  Wilson wrote,  it is hard to imagine how a statute could impair and impede the initiative process more.   Broniec, in her dissent, took a broader interpretation of the word  repeal,  saying that it is also defined as the ability to  effectively render invalid.   She called the majority opinion  an absurd result contrary to the plain language  of the state constitution.  If Amendment 3 passes, Broniec wrote, Missouri s current abortion ban cannot continue to stand. She noted a handful of other current laws that could be in conflict with the amendment, including parental consent for minors and the mandatory 72-hour waiting period between meeting with a doctor and receiving an abortion.   Today s opinion from the Missouri Supreme Court was a complete rejection of the anti-abortion politicians  arguments and attempts to subvert our constitutional right to vote to protect reproductive freedom,  Tori Schafer, an attorney with the ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement Friday.  Including access to abortion, birth control and miscarriage care.   Coleman, one of the plaintiffs, wrote on social media Friday that she agreed the issue at hand wasn t abortion.   It is about abrogating the will of the general assembly,  Coleman wrote.  By using absurd arguments to reach their desired result.   Mary Catherine Martin, an attorney with the Thomas More Society who represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement Friday that she still believes the crafters of the initiative petition violated state laws.   It should not require courage to clearly apply the law, but it does when powerful political forces oppose a just outcome,  Martin said.  We applaud the courage of these three dissenting judges.   The Supreme Court published its decision on Aug. 10, a few hours after oral arguments were completed and less than three hours before the constitutional deadline to remove a question from the ballot.  In their decision, the majority reversed a lower court ruling made just four days earlier by Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who recommended the measure be stripped from the Nov. 5 ballot.  As part of its decision, the Supreme Court ordered that Ashcroft  certify to local election authorities that Amendment 3 be placed on the Nov. 5, 2024, general election ballot and shall take all steps necessary to ensure that it is on said ballot.   A day earlier, Ashcroft, in an unprecedented move, attempted to decertify the ballot measure based on the lower court s ruling, and temporarily removed Amendment 3 from the Secretary of State s website.  Correction: This story was updated at 4:10 p.m. to clarify that Chief Justice Mary Russell was appointed by former Democratic Gov. Bob Holden."
3,40,Physicians for Human Rights - PHR,Delayed and Denied: How Florida’s Six-Week Abortion Ban Criminalizes Medical Care,,https://phr.org/our-work/resources/delayed-and-denied-floridas-six-week-abortion-ban/,"Executive Summary  In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion.[1] In July 2022, Florida enacted a ban on abortion care after 15 weeks of gestation from the first day of a pregnant person s last menstrual period, with only limited exceptions.[2] Two years later, in April 2024 the Florida Supreme Court followed suit and overturned decades of precedent that the Florida Constitution s Privacy Clause protects the right to abortion. This judgment cleared the way for a new, far more restrictive six-week abortion ban to take effect on May 1, 2024.[3] This ban shifted the legal limit for abortion from 15 weeks to six weeks from the first day of a pregnant person s last menstrual period and included only very narrow exceptions that differed from those in the 15-week ban. The penalties for those who violate the ban are severe, including imprisonment, fines, and loss of medical licenses.[4] On the same day that the Florida Supreme Court revoked state constitutional protection of abortion rights, however, it also allowed a proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights into Florida s Constitution to be included on the state s November 2024 ballot for voters  consideration.  Florida s extreme abortion ban has created an unworkable legal landscape that endangers both patients and clinicians. The ban violates individual reproductive freedom, leads to preventable suffering, and compels clinicians to deviate from established standards of care and medical ethics. These denials constitute violations of Floridians  fundamental rights, including their human rights to life, health, privacy, freedom from torture and cruelty, and equality.  In July and August 2024, PHR researchers conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 25 reproductive health care clinicians and clinicians in training in Florida about their experiences caring for pregnant patients under the six-week ban. In these interviews, clinicians stated that while abortion clinics in the state continue to provide care where legally permitted, Florida s six-week ban is creating insurmountable barriers to abortion care for many patients. Clinicians described how the unworkability of the ban s narrow exceptions and the severe chilling effect on abortion provision caused by the sweeping criminalization of abortion from a very early stage of pregnancy are endangering patients  health and survival and impairing clinicians  ability to comply with their ethical obligations and medical standards of care.  Clinicians shared multiple examples of cases of delays and denials of reproductive health care including abortion care and miscarriage management, disruption of the patient-clinician relationship, deviations from standard medical care, impaired training of new clinicians, and an exodus of health care providers from the state, worsening Florida s already severe health care provider shortages. Alarmingly, clinicians stated that patient care is being impeded by Florida s broad abortion ban even in cases of ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and preterm premature rupture of membranes, despite state health agency rules that state that these conditions should not be considered abortion.[5]  Clinicians interviewed described the devastating consequences of the abortion ban for their patients. Many patients do not realize they are pregnant until after the legal limit – just two weeks after a missed period – and the required 24-hour waiting period between a first face-to-face appointment with an abortion provider and receiving an abortion further narrows the window for care. Patients are referred to tertiary care centers and abortion-providing facilities within the state as hospitals grapple with confusion about what the exceptions include and direct patients to seek more specialized clinicians  authorization to avoid risk. Ultimately, the law s narrow exceptions do not cover many serious conditions, forcing patients to either travel out of state for medical care or continue pregnancies with severe health risks. As clinicians deliberated whether they could legally offer care, patients experiencing medical emergencies requiring pregnancy termination, miscarriages where they needed medical intervention, and even cancer faced delays and even denials of treatment due to the ban. This disruption in medical care disproportionately impacts low-income and marginalized communities, who already face barriers to prenatal and maternal health care. Additionally, the emotional and physical toll on these patients is profound, as they are often left with few possible options for care.  The broader implications of Florida s abortion ban are alarming. Clinicians  testimonies highlight ways that Florida s ban is jeopardizing prenatal care and will likely further worsen the state s already poor maternal health outcomes.[6] The ban also threatens the future of reproductive health care in Florida, as medical training in essential procedures like dilations and curettages (D&C) and dilations and evacuations (D&E) after the first trimester is severely limited. This lack of training not only impacts abortion care but also the management of miscarriages and other pregnancy complications, posing a significant risk to patient safety. Reflecting on these devastating impacts, clinicians called for the lifting of the six-week ban.  Florida s extreme abortion ban has created an unworkable legal landscape that endangers both patients and clinicians. The ban violates individual reproductive freedom, leads to preventable suffering, and compels clinicians to deviate from established standards of care and medical ethics. These denials constitute violations of Floridians  fundamental rights, including their human rights to life, health, privacy, freedom from torture and cruelty, and equality. This research brief underscores the urgent need to ensure the right to comprehensive reproductive health care in Florida.  Introduction  The United States (U.S.) Supreme Court ruling on June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization (Dobbs) overturned the 50-year-old precedent set by Roe v. Wade and eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion.[7] Two years after Dobbs, in April 2024 the Florida Supreme Court followed suit and overturned its own 1989 judgment and decades of precedent that the Florida Constitution s Privacy Clause protects the right to abortion.[8] On May 1, 2024, Florida s six-week ban took effect, shifting the legal limit for abortion from 15 weeks to six weeks from the first day of a pregnant person s last menstrual period.[9] [10] The six-week ban punishes any person who  willfully performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy  in violation of the law as a third-degree felony with up to five years in prison, up to a US$5000 fine, loss of medical licenses, or all the above. Unlike many other states, Florida s ban does not clearly exempt pregnant people themselves from criminal prosecution.[11]  The six-week ban in Florida criminalizes the termination of pregnancy before many individuals are aware that they are pregnant – typically two weeks after a missed period in a standard four-week menstrual cycle. The new Florida ban provides limited exceptions in situations of medical necessity to save a pregnant person s life; to  avert a serious risk of imminent substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function…other than a psychological condition;  in cases of fatal fetal impairment where a pregnancy has not reached the third trimester; and in pregnancies resulting from rape, incest, or trafficking prior to 15 weeks only if the patient provides  a copy of a restraining order, police report, medical record, or other court order or documentation providing evidence  that they are obtaining the termination of pregnancy because they are a victim of rape, incest, or human trafficking.  The six-week ban replaces the previous 15-week ban that was instituted on July 1, 2022.[12] Some of the new ban s exceptions differ from those of the 15-week ban, exacerbating confusion about when abortion is legally permitted.[13] For example, the 15-week ban s  fatal fetal abnormality  exception allowed abortion  before viability,  unlike the six-week ban that states the limit is  before the third trimester. [14]  On the same day that the Florida Supreme Court revoked state constitutional protection of abortion rights, in 2024, it also allowed a proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights into Florida s Constitution to be included on the state s November 2024 ballot for voters  consideration.[15] The proposed Florida amendment says, in part, that no  law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient s health, as determined by the patient s health care provider.  It would need approval from 60 percent of voters to be enacted.[16]  In addition, the day after the six-week ban went into effect, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) released emergency rules – stating that certain pregnancy terminations, including for premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM), ectopic pregnancy, and trophoblastic tumors, should not be considered abortion for reporting purposes. These guidelines lack medical clarity, further confusing clinicians.[17] [18] Compounding these laws and guidelines, targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP) laws (procedural requirements on facilities and individuals who can provide abortion care), along with the 24-hour waiting periods between the two required in-person abortion care appointments in Florida, further complicate service delivery and lead to confusion on how providers can best care for their patients.[19]  After the six-week ban went into effect, PHR undertook fact-finding interviews from July to August 2024 with 25 clinicians and clinicians in training to document whether and, if so, how Florida s abortion ban is impacting patients, health care workers, and access to health care. We interviewed clinicians in obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, family medicine, reproductive endocrinology, certified nurse midwifery, medical students, and genetic counselors across the state, with representation in varied practice types that include public and private hospitals, academic medical centers, private practices, and free-standing abortion-providing facilities.  In these interviews, clinicians described the serious and manifold harms the ban is causing pregnant people in the state who seek reproductive health care. The six-week ban is unclear in its guidelines and introduces barriers to care, delays in emergency reproductive services, and deviations from standard medical care. Moreover, the steep penalties, particularly when combined with other laws, create intensified fear and confusion among health care providers who do not know in what cases they legally can or cannot provide abortion care, creating strain in the patient-clinician relationship and inducing providers and trainees to leave the state. Clinicians report receiving warnings from hospital administrators, legislators, and others that they may be targeted for providing necessary abortions and that these laws are being strictly enforced. This has led to an overall chilling effect on the provision of reproductive health care and has hindered access to abortion care for pregnant people, many of whom have a medical necessity for the procedure.[20] Thus, the six-week ban has rendered the already complex legal landscape for abortion in Florida even more unworkable in practice, with restrictions that endanger both clinicians and pregnant patients in the state.  Florida s Reproductive Health Landscape  As of 2024, 20 percent of Florida s population – 4.6 million women- are of reproductive age (between 15 and 44 years old).[21] Health care costs and accessibility create significant barriers in access to health care generally for people of reproductive age in Florida. Florida s health care system ranks among the worst in the U.S. in terms of accessibility and affordability, especially for women s health, possibly driven by the lack of Medicaid expansion.[22] [23] Florida is currently experiencing extensive shortages of physicians, dentists, and mental health providers compared to the needs of the state s population.[24] Further, an estimated 13 of Florida s 67 counties are maternity care  deserts,  or counties without access to hospital or birth centers offering obstetric care or without obstetric care providers. Another 11 counties have low or moderate access to maternity care.  Pregnant people in Florida have long faced delays in accessing prenatal care.[25] In 2021, before the Dobbs decision, fewer than two out of every three pregnant people received prenatal care within the first four months of pregnancy (64.7 percent).[26] Florida is rated the second worst in the nation currently for the provision of prenatal care, which creates serious risks for pregnant people in the state, including already marginalized populations who face higher barriers to quality maternal health care.[27] For example, in Florida, in 2020, Black and Hispanic women died from pregnancy-related death at nearly four times and one and a half times the rate of non-Hispanic white women, respectively. [28] Of concern, nearly one in five of these pregnancy-related deaths in Florida were attributed to systemic care issues, such as a lack of standardized policies, procedures and care coordination.[29]  Over the past decades until the recent bans, abortion care was available throughout Florida. Even under the 15-week ban, Florida provided crucial access to abortion for Floridians and others in the U.S. South who lived in states with more extreme laws.[30] Prior to the Dobbs decision in June 2022, abortion was legal in Florida up to the third trimester, defined as starting 26 weeks after the last menstrual period.[31] A 24-hour waiting period for abortions went into effect in April 2022, followed shortly by the 15-week ban that went into effect in July 2022. As of March 2024, Florida had 54 abortion clinics.[32]  Once the six-week ban went into effect in May 2024, there have been significant decreases in abortions within the state in May and June compared to comparable periods last year in Florida.[33] While abortion clinics in the state continue to provide crucial care within the legal limits, many Floridians have been forced to travel outside the state for abortion care. The National Abortion Federation, which runs the largest patient assistance fund in the country to help people afford abortion care, reported a 575 percent increase in callers requesting funding in the two months since the ban went into effect in May, compared to the same time last year.[34] This has contributed to more than a 30 percent increase in wait times at abortion clinics across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, DC. North Carolina has seen the largest increase despite having a 72-hour waiting period, with wait times increasing in half of the state s 16 clinics.[35] The long-term impact on abortion clinics in Florida remains uncertain, but in other states with severe abortion restrictions 66 clinics closed across 15 states, with 14 states losing all abortion-providing facilities[36] within 100 days[37] of the Dobbs decision. Clinics in states with bans face significant challenges in maintaining[38] staff and financial viability, and even if abortion rights are restored, reversing closures can be difficult, creating lasting impacts on access to care.[39]  The passage of the six-week ban raises serious questions about the impact on Florida s existing challenges in the provision of health care and specifically care for pregnant patients. Health care worker shortages, barriers to prenatal care, and barriers to abortion currently contribute to significant health harms in the state. Against this backdrop, it is critical to understand reproductive health care clinicians  experiences providing care to pregnant patients under the six-week ban.  Research Methodology  In July and August 2024, the PHR research team conducted outreach to reproductive health community-based organizations and professional networks in Florida. These contacts facilitated connections to reproductive health care providers ( clinicians ), medical students and genetic counselors who have provided reproductive or pregnancy health care in Florida post-Dobbs. The research team then used snowball sampling, an established sampling strategy for research on hard-to-reach populations or sensitive topics, which has been used to conduct qualitative research in comparable studies.[40] Clinicians consented to 30- to 60-minute, semi-structured, in-depth, confidential interviews. Interview guides were developed based on the expertise of the research team and conversations with partner organizations. Transcripts were de-identified and cleaned by interviewers, and data was stored on a password-protected server and only accessed by the research teams. Study recruitment ended when we reached concept saturation, the point at which no new themes emerged from additional interviews.[41] Thematic analysis was used to identify experiences across interviews. The two interviewers (WA and MH) read transcripts of the clinician interviews after a third of the interviews were completed; through a hybrid approach they identified key themes emerging from the data (inductive analysis) and based on the research questions (deductive analysis) to develop a codebook. One interviewer (WA) coded all the transcripts, adding more codes as they emerged from the data. Illustrative quotes were selected based on key themes.[42] PHR s Ethics Review Board (ERB) approved the study with exempt status. See Appendix 1 for characteristics of the 25 clinicians interviewed.  Findings  Florida s abortion ban and unworkable exceptions pose insurmountable barriers to abortion care for many patients  Abortion is currently legal in Florida only until six weeks after a pregnant person s last menstrual period (LMP) with limited exceptions.[43] As one obstetrician-gynecologist said:  While it is limited, abortion is still legal. There has definitely been some confusion. It is still legal.  While health care facilities across the state continue to provide abortion care to pregnant patients within the laws  narrow confines, as one clinician emphasized, the unworkable exceptions and extreme gestational limits mean many patients are barred from care:   It is virtually a total abortion ban. Most people do not know that they are pregnant at six weeks. Considering the 24-hour waiting period, it is virtually a complete ban. So, do not be fooled that this is a compromise. It is not.  (14)  Many people do not know that the timeline for calculating the abortion ban begins from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) on ultrasound and not the estimated date of conception  Many clinicians noted that many of their patients did not realize that pregnancy is dated from the first day of their last menstrual period. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) measurement guidelines, for example, are based on the first day of the patient s last menstrual period confirmed with an ultrasound measurement.[44] Clinicians reported that since the six-week ban, their patients who come in seeking an abortion right when they discover that they are pregnant are often distraught that they are considered further along in their pregnancy than they had assumed and are unable to receive an abortion within Florida. A clinician at an abortion care facility described how often she faces this:   There is at least one person a week who is really angry and does not trust the ultrasound [results]. What is behind it is that they do not understand how the dating of pregnancy works, which is fair. It is just so confusing. And, the person is explaining to me,  There is no way I am six weeks pregnant. There is no way I am seven weeks pregnant, because this is when I had sex, and this is when I got pregnant.  And I am like,  You are 100 percent right. I agree. That is when you got pregnant. But here is how the law and the medical world define the time of pregnancy. I am so sorry.   (4)  Patients who have irregular periods may have no idea what they will measure on an ultrasound once they have discovered that they are pregnant. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us:  The other day, we had a 14-week [patient] just because she does not menstruate. And she was like,  I have no idea. I do not know when my period was. I do not know when I conceived.   (21)  Six weeks pass before many people realize they are pregnant or can secure an appointment with a provider to confirm results of a positive home pregnancy test  As many clinicians explained, many of their patients do not find out they are pregnant until after six weeks, at which point they no longer have the option to have an abortion in Florida except in narrow circumstances.[45] An obstetrician-gynecologist in private practice described:   With the six-week ban, I would say it is more like the inability to really offer anything at all now. I mean, we see patients for their new obstetrician-gynecologist visits usually around eight weeks, and sometimes we see them earlier, if they are having bleeding or other issues where we end up scanning them earlier. But I do not think I have ever had a viable pregnancy that was less than six weeks that I could offer a termination. They are never less than six weeks, so it is essentially impossible. By the time we see them for their first visit, that option is already gone.  (19)  Multiple clinicians explained that because of a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Florida, people are rarely able to secure a prenatal appointment to confirm the results of a pregnancy test with a dating ultrasound before six weeks of gestation. In the words of another obstetrician-gynecologist in private practice:   The patients that I see in the office for an initial prenatal visit are almost never less than six weeks. It is incredibly rare for somebody to be able to get in less than six weeks. I would say more often it is closer to twelve. And part of that is because of the demand, we do not have enough providers to see patients, and we are a very big practice… And then patients who are coming in for something else and then discover that they are pregnant, if they are lucky enough to be less than six weeks, just have so little time to consider their options and then hopefully get in with somebody who can provide abortion if that s what they choose.  (17)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist explained how impossible this timeline makes the option of abortion care for many of her patients:   Most women do not know that they are pregnant that early. Also [because of] the way that we label pregnancies as six weeks of pregnancy…. they have actually only been pregnant for four weeks, and most pregnancy tests do not turn positive for those first two weeks. So, they really only have two weeks. And that is total days, not business days. They have two weeks to figure out that they are pregnant, even have that on their radar. Call and get an appointment, and then get a second appointment all within six weeks and zero days  time, which is really hard.  (20)  Florida s 24-hour waiting period creates an additional barrier to receiving abortion care within legal time limits  In Florida, the first abortion appointment consists of an ultrasound to measure gestational age, where patients are read the state-mandated consent information. Patients then return at least 24 hours later for a medication (mifepristone and misoprostol) or procedural abortion (for example, D&C). Clinicians noted that clinics have been penalized by AHCA for performing abortions up to 15 weeks and six days rather than 15 weeks and zero days, under the 15-week abortion ban. While clinicians did not name a public document stating this policy, these accounts of aggressive enforcement have led facilities to err on the side of caution, and assume the same is true for the six-week ban- that to be legally eligible for abortion care under the six-week ban, the first appointment must occur no later than five weeks and six days after the beginning of a patient s last menstrual period ifthey can schedule the abortion for the next day. However, most abortion-providing facilities are not open or do not provide abortion procedures every day of the week. As a clinician who provides abortion care described:   [In Florida] abortion clinics are not open seven days a week. [One clinic is] open on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So, if you are seen on Thursday and you are five weeks and four days – we cannot provide for your care. And, like, maybe a [city] an hour and a half away, is booked up, and they do not have appointments for you. And so, a six-week ban is not a six-week ban, depending on what day you are getting seen. …If you are not open for four days, it is not a six-week ban, it is a five [week] and four [day] ban.  (4)  Several obstetrician-gynecologists described how harmful the impact is on their patients who must travel to facilities hours away to receive their abortion before the six-week deadline:   I have definitely seen patients who I do the consent, and then the next day they drive [to another city across the state] for their appointment for their abortion. …I have talked with many patients who are confused about why they are being asked to drive across the state on a day s notice and have to drop everything they are doing, leave work, find childcare, pay for gas, and all these things. And I have to explain to them – this is not a rule that we implemented. This is based on state law, and we are just trying to help as much as we can.  (14)  Many fetal anomalies are unable to be detected on early ultrasound imaging before six weeks  Florida s six-week ban only permits abortion for  fatal fetal abnormalities  where termination is sought before the third trimester. The law states that  a fatal fetal anomaly  is one that is  a terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter. [46] Clinicians shared that patients faced delays and denials of abortion due to confusion about which fetal anomalies could be terminated legally, including severe anomalies that would lead to death in weeks or months – not just hours – from birth.  Clinicians described their experiences caring for patients with severe but not clearly fatal fetal anomalies during pregnancy that cannot be detected on early ultrasound imaging. One certified genetic counselor said:   When I started practicing, the legal limit to have an abortion was 23 weeks and six days. So, for the majority of our patients at that time, we were able to get them the care. Some patients who were late to care or things were found later on ultrasounds, we helped them go out of state, but that was few and far in between. So, then when the 15-week abortion ban came into place, obviously that made things a lot harder, but we were still able to get in, not necessarily the ultrasound findings, because those are just very hard to see anything super well under 15 weeks, but the very severe ones, we would still be able to get them in. And then we really pushed for, in our practice, [getting people in] for chromosomal screening right at the 10-week mark when they can do it or as early as possible. So, when the results are back that we would be able to do diagnostic procedures at 12 weeks and then we can get those results back before the legal timing limit to get abortions. But it was hard because there was no time to spare, essentially. Like things had to get in very quickly. …But anything past that, any anomalies had to go out of state.  (22)  Fear of criminal charges has caused delays and denials of emergency reproductive health care to patients  Clinicians repeatedly shared how Florida s narrow exceptions to the overall criminalization of abortion has led to widespread fear that has hindered access to care and harmed patients. Clinicians at tertiary care centers reported receiving increased referrals from clinicians afraid to care for complicated pregnant patients under the current laws. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us:   I have seen a surge in patients coming to me that I was not seeing before that were being handled by the community and getting care elsewhere. Patients [are] coming desperate, [saying]  They would not sign off on this. I do not know what to do. They just said, go to [tertiary care hospital].  So, I get a lot of phone calls from my residents about patients in the ER, [telling me],  They are 18 weeks, and they have bilateral renal agenesis [lack of both kidneys which is usually fatal] in the fetus …and they are like,  I want an abortion.   (11)  One maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist explained one basis for this fear:  The state has come down very hard on a couple abortion centers that [the state argued had] deviated on the cutoffs as the law changed from 15 weeks to 6 weeks. And so, the fear is that the state is actually looking for a scapegoat to go after.  (13) This MFM also noted referrals from providers afraid that they would not fill out correctly the extensive and confusing required paperwork by the state for legally allowable abortions and would thus be prosecuted:   We are seeing tons of referrals that would not have been made before [the abortion ban]. I even see doctors that are two blocks away from me going, I am too intimidated by all the state paperwork. I know exactly that this fits the criteria, but I just do not know how to fill it out, how to date it, how to sign it. There are all these rules. We are just sending the patient to you so you can do the paperwork.  (13)  Several clinicians described how fear and lack of clarity about the narrow medical exceptions are leading to patients being sent out of state for abortions even in situations where abortion care could be considered to be legal. One obstetrician-gynecologist hospitalist stated:   I would say 99 percent of MFMs in our state are not entirely aware of the laws or they are scared of the laws. So instead of calling a clinician who does abortions [in Florida] and asking them,  Would this qualify for an exemption?  They just automatically refer the patient out of state. Because they do not want to be on record saying that they think this is a lethal anomaly or that they think that this is going to endanger maternal life…. And so, they just say,  Go to North Carolina or Virginia or whatever it is. …Since the six-week [ban] went in place, literally zero clinician sign off has occurred [at my hospital], because I think people are just being directed elsewhere. [It is] just an even more unnecessary burden on the patient. Like, it is bad enough she is going through this bad outcome that she did not sign up for, now you are making her travel out of state when she really does not have to. There is a multitude of doctors in Florida who remain who are capable of doing [abortions]. But people are just scared.  (21)  Delays in securing hospital approvals due to hospital concerns about violating Florida s abortion ban in turn are delaying emergency care for pregnant patients  Multiple clinicians recounted how the abortion ban vaguely defined narrow exceptions had led to difficulties in securing approval for medically necessary abortion care from their health care facilities. Several clinicians described cases of being required by their hospitals to wait until patients become  sick enough  to qualify for care. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us about an incident which occurred under the 15-week ban:   I strongly remember a patient who had severe kidney disease and was admitted to the hospital and was teetering on the edge of that 15 weeks. I think she was 14 weeks or so, and she got admitted, and we were trying to figure out how best to help her. She was getting sicker and sicker…. [We] had to bring it to the head people of the hospital and be like,  What are we allowed to do?  And they were like,  She is not sick enough yet.  And we had to wait for her to get sicker before we were even allowed to offer her termination. And she was past 15 weeks at that point. …I think it took over two weeks for us to get an answer from the hospital administrators. …So that hit very strongly, because it was kind of insane that we had to wait for her to become sicker. We had to wait for her creatinine to bump and her kidneys to be about to fail before we were allowed to even offer her [termination]. Then we had to jump through so many hoops to be able to do it. It really changed everything that we did in our practice.  (19)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist recounted another case of delay in care for a patient facing a potentially fatal pregnancy complication:   [There] was a patient who was like 20 to 21 weeks and developed severe Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets [HELLP], a life-threatening liver and blood clotting disorder of pregnancy whose definitive treatment requires removal of the fetus and placenta …She also had COVID-19 and she was very isolated and her care got significantly delayed because we had to get approval to terminate her pregnancy in the hospital and she got pretty sick.  (18)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist described the impacts on pregnant patients of long delays in securing hospital approval for medically necessary abortions:   There were times where we had to wait weeks before we had answers. And then that is just pushing the pregnancy further and further along for a sick patient or someone who is already struggling with those choices that they were having to make.  (19)  While the six-week ban allows terminations where there is a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant person, clinicians described delays in the provision of abortion due to confusion about what constitutes a  serious  risk as well as the need for approval by hospital administrations. One obstetrician-gynecologist shared the account of a patient with a cardiac issue who had an increased risk of death postpartum:   After [my patient s] fifth pregnancy, she had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Almost died … and she is pregnant again…. I had to present her case, and she was, I think, 18 weeks pregnant…. There is no question her life would be at risk carrying this pregnancy and it is happening again, most likely postpartum. Well, then, is the pregnancy really putting her at risk? And, you know, I had to sit before five or six or seven hospital administrators and make an argument for this woman. And the data I could pull was that there probably was up to about a 10 percent chance of this happening again, but it is a 10 percent chance of dying because if she had another spontaneous coronary dissection, she s dead. And I had to hear these people say,  Well, is 10 percent a lot? Is that enough?  I said,  Are you kidding me? I guarantee if you ask her five children is 10 percent a lot, a big chance of losing your mom? Does that sound like a lot? They would say yes.  But it is this back and forth, and it is just this kind of chaos. But who makes these decisions? It just leaves you in a stalemate sometimes. … I eventually got to a point where my hospital said, okay, yes, we can do this. It took me two to three weeks to get to that point. And you obviously know [that delay] matters. You are 15 weeks, 16, 17, or 18. The procedure changes a little bit, and the risk changes a little bit.  (11)  Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and ectopic pregnancy care is still being delayed despite AHCA emergency rule  Following the six-week ban going into effect, AHCA, a state agency, issued a rule stating procedures to treat PPROM, ectopic pregnancy, and trophoblastic tumors would not be considered abortions for state reporting purposes. Despite this, several obstetrician-gynecologists reported that their patients are afraid that they will not be able to receive care for these conditions, which makes it incredibly  challenging,  as one clinician worded it, to provide care. In the words of one:  [for] molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, even though the state has said in their AHCA emergency rule that those are not,  abortion care,  there is still so much confusion and fear on the part of our patients that they are not going to be able to get care or that they will get in trouble.  (1)  Indeed, these fears are not unfounded. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us that her hospital still required them to have a two-doctor signoff for PPROM to protect them in case the state decided to prosecute, even though PPROM should not count as abortion provision under the AHCA emergency rule:   We did get guidance after the six-week law was passed…. So now we are able to discuss with patients what we call active management if their water is broken at a PPROM. So, we are lucky compared to other states in that regard. But still, it is so intrusive. Okay, here you are. Tragic your water is broken. We are worried about these things. You do not want to stay pregnant. Let us roll in with a brochure of state paperwork. Let us start filling it all out together, because even though you know what you want, we have to do all this paperwork. And the law is not that clear. So, we still do two signatures. Like there is still a delay that occurs with all of this that seems unnecessary in a situation where delay potentially could increase the chance of infection.  (13)  Clinicians at small rural hospitals and at religious-affiliated hospitals described how their hospitals were recommending that patients with PPROM to be transferred to larger, academic hospitals or tertiary care. These delays in care could result in additional health complications for patients, and this chilling effect extends to broader pregnancy care. One obstetrician-gynecologist described a case of a patient who developed complications due to delays in referring her to another hospital for termination that the obstetrician-gynecologist would have provided before the abortion ban:   We had a patient who had PPROM, she was like 18 weeks and she desired termination. Basically, what we have to do is send a referral to our MFM, who then can refer her to [academic hospital] for care, and in that process [the patient] got infected, got chorioamnionitis and became septic and ended up needing admission and IV antibiotics at the academic hospital. So, yeah, just not being able to just admit that patient that day and proceed with an induction was unfortunate for her.  (18)  And, as another obstetrician-gynecologist at a rural hospital recounted, options in Florida for transfers requiring abortion procedures are increasingly limited:  I have thought about that – where do I send people? So, I know if I get somebody in who wants a D&E who is PPROM, I have to send them to that one hospital because I do not think any of the other ones would do the procedure.  (5)  We also heard similar accounts about ectopic pregnancy care. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us care was still being delayed in their ER for ectopic pregnancies, as ER clinicians were afraid to provide methotrexate to patients as it was an  abortive agent :   I was on call and we were trying to give methotrexate and were getting pushback from one of the emergency room providers. It was mostly from nursing, but I guess the physician assistant [PA] was the one that was mediating this between us. But we had a patient who had an evacuation already and was still having rising human chorionic gonadotropin [HCGs], a hormone indicating pregnancy and to everybody in the obstetric world, that is an ectopic unless proven otherwise. And she had come in specifically to get methotrexate. Like she had been sent in from [abortion-providing facility] to get methotrexate from our team. And so, we ordered it, and we had to have this back and forth. We were EPIC chatting [texting within the medical record], having this kind of disagreement back and forth. I actually printed out the AHCA code and [a resident] brought it down and there was still a lot of back and forth. It ended up being one of our labor and delivery nurses just went down and gave the medication. It is like a very big conversation on a bunch of email threads now because of this. And we had [another] recent case, [a] similar situation where they were refusing to give it because they were concerned about the legality of giving it as an – they kept calling it an abortive agent.  (25)  Narrow and unclear exception for  fatal fetal anomalies  is causing confusion and leading to denial of care to patients with severe diagnoses  Clinicians noted that the Florida law s exception for fatal fetal anomalies does not cover many serious conditions. The state has defined  fatal fetal abnormalities  as  a terminal condition  that is  incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter. [47] As one MFM specialist explained:   So, the actual term is  imminently lethal,  which is not a medical term…. So, a patient comes in or has a condition that is genetic, and let us say 100 percent of the time, the baby is going to die of a debilitating neurologic condition by age three or by three months of age even, they cannot terminate in the state of Florida. And so, that is an interesting conversation to have with people because many people … have no idea that their rights have been stripped away. And so, I end up having conversations where people get really angry with me because they cannot terminate.  (13)  A genetic counselor told us that their hospital had decided in consultation with the lawyers that  imminently lethal  meant  lethal, essentially, within the first day of life.  (22) Another genetic counselor recounted the case of a patient whose fetal diagnosis was not considered  imminently lethal :   A patient had two children who had a very rare genetic condition. They passed away four months of age. …The patient came to me in her third pregnancy, had already had diagnostic testing done, and just to talk a little bit about coordinating out of state abortion. All the providers who have seen her … nobody felt comfortable saying that this is lethal immediately post-delivery. Right, because is four months immediately post-delivery? And I think it is things like that where you are sitting there and you are like, what defines, you know, severity? And this is for, you know, a mother who lost two children who did not want to go through that suffering again or see them go through that again in her words, we could not give a time limit [for lethal].  (12)  Multiple clinicians described conditions in the gray area of the law that might be quite severe, but did not meet the criteria for being lethal immediately upon delivery. These patients who do not meet this narrow criterion for exceptions are forced to travel out of state or continue the pregnancy. As one obstetrician-gynecologist said:   There is no amount of legal wording that can account for and pay respect to the complexities of medical care that can arise. …And so, what I have seen with these families [who] are in this area of gray is that they end up needing to travel out of state for abortion care because these exceptions are very narrow. And if they happen to be unlucky enough that their baby has a condition that does not necessarily meet this narrow exception, their health care team is going to be reluctant to care for them because they do not want to be prosecuted for not following the law. And so, in many instances, I have had patients travel out of state.  (2)  Pregnant people who do not qualify for narrow exceptions must travel out of state or continue pregnancies with severe health consequences  Due to the concentration of abortion bans in the southern U.S., patients in Florida have limited options for facility-based care. The closest states with higher gestational limits are North Carolina, which currently limits abortion provision to 12 weeks with exceptions for life-limiting fetal anomalies up to 24 weeks, and Virginia, which allows abortion until viability.[48] For many patients, traveling to another state is impossible. Out-of-state travel requires that people have significant resources such as financial means, travel experience, childcare for their other children, and time off from work. A clinician at an abortion care facility said:   There are patients who come in at six weeks, zero days to sign their consent, and 24 hours later, they would be six weeks, one day. They come in with a stroller with two babies:  I cannot go to North Carolina. I am a single mom. I do not have any [paid time off]. What do you want me to do here?  And, I mean, what I am asking of them is,  Hey, can you travel 300 miles for a five-minute procedure or 800 miles for a five-minute procedure?  It is insane.  (3)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist who provided reproductive health care to incarcerated patients pointed out that they now have no options for abortion care, as the prisons will not send incarcerated pregnant people out of state for abortion care:  My patients who were in the jail, they will take them to the clinic down the street, but they are not taking them out of state.  (5)  Clinicians described patients for whom English is a second language or who have recently immigrated to the U.S. as being among those most affected, as they were often less familiar with navigating the U.S. health care system. A clinician described the difficulties of non-English-speaking patients with fetal anomalies trying to navigate the American medical system to make health care appointments in another state.   I just had a case this past week of a very nice couple. They did not speak English. The baby had a severe, debilitating abnormality that was not lethal. … a very large spinal bifida defect. They did not have it in them to stay pregnant. And absolutely, they were going to travel out of state to get care. I went through the long discussion with the translator about everything and about the options and pulled up a couple of out of state places. And at this point, I am 45 minutes behind in my schedule… [and the patient asks,]  Can you call the doctors at the top three centers and tell them about me? And can you set up those appointments for me?  And I felt so bad. I said,  No, actually, I cannot do that. That is something you have to do for yourself. …. [Afterwards] it haunted me. I left her with a really daunting task.  (13)  Being forced to travel out-of-state or continue pregnancies can result in compounding harms. A genetic counselor described the emotional impacts on patients who must travel out-of-state for pregnancies with life-limiting fetal diagnoses, where people reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and grief that was compounded by the stress of needing to leave the state to receive abortion care.   I had some patients who … had to travel out of state for medically indicated terminations. [It] was a really traumatizing experience. [Thinking of one patient seen last week], …. to have to travel out of state and have to do everything with doctors that she did not know in a state and in a health care system she did not know. It was really hard for her. She got good care. But it is a really sad thing to have these patients you have established relationships with have to leave and be off work and hopefully have somebody with them also supporting them and spend all that money. It is just that they report PTSD and, of course, grief. But I think that the grief is a lot more complicated than it could have been.  (17)  Multiple clinicians interviewed recounted the stories of patients unable to travel out of state for care who were forced to continue their pregnancies, even if they faced precarious social, financial, or health situations. A MFM specialist recalled one recent patient:   I had a patient who was Spanish speaking, who had a trisomy 18-week pregnancy with a heart defect. Now, 30 percent of those babies will die prior to labor, 30 percent will die in labor, and the majority that are born will die in the subsequent hours to days to weeks after birth, with a small minority able to survive beyond a year. So, we made this diagnosis at about 18 weeks gestation, but these babies can live for hours or days. And so, I knew that just sending this case for review based on state laws was unlikely to be approved because there is so much fear. So, I sent the patient to the pediatric cardiologist. They said, it is a heart defect, and the baby has trisomy 18, but I cannot say that it is a lethal heart defect. I was the one that had the relationship with the patient, so I had to crawl back to her with a translator and tell her that we could not take care of her within our hospital system. So that left her with the only option of going out of state. And that is when she started to cry. And she told me that she is the only caregiver of her mother with severe Alzheimer s. She had two small children …it would take [two to three days] to travel out of state to get the care and to terminate. But she was like,  There is no one that my mother will allow in her dementia to care for her. I am stuck in this state, so I am stuck staying pregnant.  And she did. And two months later, the baby died in utero. And you can think of all the hurt there was for her in carrying a pregnancy for eight weeks for no reason other than state laws intimidating and altering patient care.  (13)  A genetic counselor said about patients whose fetuses have severe anomalies and who continue their pregnancies because they did not meet narrow criteria for lethal fetal anomalies and could not travel:   I am seeing patients continuing because they must. Because they do not have the finances or sometimes not even finances. A patient last week could not get childcare. She is a single mom [who] cannot travel out of state for a couple of days, even though financially, we can with some of the funds and things like that make that happen. Somebody has to take care of her kids, and she does not have that. … I feel like my job has become panic coordinator for people as opposed to, truly, we are aligning values, we are making decisions. I feel like there is this sense of panic.  (12)  Florida s abortion ban causes deviations from standard of medical care clinicians otherwise would provide to patients, including molar pregnancies, miscarriage management, and cancer treatment  Clinicians spoke to how the ban led to violations of patient autonomy, violations of pregnant people s freedom to make decisions about their bodies, that themselves constituted deviations from the standard of care and ethical treatment of patients:   The standard of care is that patients have bodily autonomy, and that is one of the main ethical pillars of medicine. And when you take that away, it absolutely impacts the standard of care.  (24)  For example, another obstetrician-gynecologist told us about delays in abortion care for a patient with terminal cancer:   She had recurrent metastatic pancreatic cancer. She beat it two times, and this was her third recurrence, and it was stage four, terminal. And because she had been on and off chemotherapy and radiation for the better part of five years, because of her recurrences, her periods had been irregular for ages…. And she has always wanted to be pregnant, but never could because of her treatments. And it was on a routine PET scan that she found out she was pregnant, unimaginable. And she was over 20 weeks, like 21 weeks. [She] had no clue because of all of the reasons I just said. Her oncologist said,  We have to stop treatment unless you have an abortion, essentially because this poses a risk to the pregnancy.   She came to us for an abortion after the six-week ban at around 21 weeks pregnant, and given the oncologist saying, we have to withhold treatment, I was like, certainly that is a health exception. And it took so, so much legal back and forth to ensure that we had all this really specific documentation from her oncologist…. [And then I realized she needed hospital-based abortion care due to her medical risks which took time to find.] I ultimately found one about an hour flight away, probably about a four-hour drive away, who was willing to do it. And then we had to go through all of the legal hoop jumping for that hospital [all over again]. And then we had to tell the patient, you have to drive 4 hours for this care while you are literally dying of cancer. She ultimately got [the abortion], and, like, thank God that we were able to set it up. …  In the middle of all that, you want to grab these Supreme Court judges and bring them in the room and say, look what you are doing to people. Let this woman be able to receive palliative chemotherapy, which is the least we can do for her, for Christ s sake. What we put her through was so cruel and unnecessary. It took over a week for her to be able to get the procedure.  (3)  Some clinicians discussed how Florida s current abortion ban pushed them to provide abortion care earlier, when they otherwise would have strongly recommended that patients wait for more information about the pregnancy. A gestational sac is not visible at all on ultrasound until approximately 4.5 to 5 weeks of pregnancy,[49] so even in cases where a possible abnormality may be observed that early, clinicians have a limited amount of time to try to determine severity before the patients will be ineligible for abortion care.  A clinician working at an abortion care facility gave an example of this deviation from standard of care for the treatment of possible or partial molar pregnancies, which require more time to diagnose than allowed by the six-week ban[50]:   It is happening a lot around possible molar pregnancies where it is just a weird looking ultrasound, and in an ideal world, it would be like, all right, let us get some blood work. I am not 100 percent sure this is a molar pregnancy. Let us have you come back in a week and just see what is going on. And you cannot [with a six-week ban]. It pushes you to do, like, substandard medical care.  (4)  Rather than being able to wait and confirm the molar pregnancy before deciding on treatment, clinicians need to treat patients early, before being able to confirm this on an ultrasound.[51] Additionally, clinicians noted that the law limited treatment of patients who have a medication abortion failure and needed a second round of treatment but are now past the six-week limit. Patients might then be forced to continue the pregnancy, and continuing a pregnancy after exposure to misoprostol has a small increased risk of fetal malformations.[52] A clinician at an abortion facility described the problem:   The other thing that worries me is if a patient who comes in and they are going to do a [medication] abortion, say, at five weeks and four days, okay, if they are one of the two percent of failure, and now they come in [for a follow-up appointment] and they are six weeks and three days, what do we tell them? Sorry, it is now illegal. That is a terrible conversation to have with somebody.  (9)  Several clinicians described patients experiencing miscarriages being turned away from emergency departments and then facing additional barriers to care due to fear of legal risks.[53] One obstetrician-gynecologist described how Florida s abortion ban has caused a chilling effect, where staff in the emergency department (ED) are frightened and unsure about what care they can provide under state law.   We had a patient who must have been 13 to 14 weeks, quite small still, who came in with concern about having a miscarriage. And we had seen her down in the ED, and we could tell that she was dilated, and her water had broken…. At that time, we had not yet confirmed if there was still a heartbeat in the fetus. When I reexamined her, [she was beginning to deliver] …., and she is not bleeding out or anything, but she is crying. She and her partner are very upset. They know that this baby is not going to survive, whether it has a heartbeat or not, and that this is going to end in a miscarriage. And she is looking at me and telling me,  I cannot mentally handle this anymore. I know, we all know, what is going to happen. Just pull it out. I want to be done.  And the ED nurse put her hand on my arm and was like,  I do not think you can do that.  And it was just so heartbreaking to have to look at a patient and say,  I can see how much pain you are in right now. We know from the medical perspective that this is not a pregnancy that is going to survive into anything, and that we should just take it out. But because of everything that is happening legally right now, I do not know if I can. I need to get some more information, some more help.   (16)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist told us about being referred cases from nearby emergency rooms (ER):   We have gotten received a couple of [miscarriages] where an ER would not treat them for whatever reason, and the patient does not totally understand. [The ER] just kind of insisted well, just let your body take care of it. Patients are in pain, they are bleeding, they are out of work, waiting to get an appointment at [an abortion clinic], and then we have to bother them with,  Wait, what medical records do you have?  Because we must legally make sure, can we clearly defend that this is a miscarriage? While the patient is standing there, frustrated and it has been a week, and they are bleeding and not working or trying to take care of their kids.  (20)  Outpatient obstetrician-gynecologists described multiple cases where a patient was clearly having a miscarriage, but care was delayed to ensure exact diagnostic criteria for miscarriage were met so that providers were protected from prosecution. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us:   What I am seeing is just by nature of our ban and by nature of being in an outpatient setting is someone with an obvious first trimester miscarriage, but who does not quite meet diagnostic criteria for a miscarriage. Meaning, the sac must measure yay big without a yolk sac, or there must be a fetal pole that is yay big without cardiac activity. And that is how you define miscarriage strictly. But there are patients in this gray area where you come in with a big sac, and it is clearly deformed because this patient has been bleeding, but it does not yet meet those exact criteria. But the patient is bleeding and cramping and in pain and wants it out. And there is obviously a risk if this has been going on for several weeks of sepsis – it is clearly not a viable pregnancy, but it does not yet meet those exact measurement criteria…. I am always like, I could document the heck out of this, but is it enough? …I could have her come back in a couple days, show that the sac is not growing to prove that it is a miscarriage. But in that time, she is miserable, she is bleeding, she is cramping, she could, God forbid, get infected. It makes no medical sense to delay care. But legally, it is really vague. Really, really vague.  (3)  Many clinicians discussed the importance of recognizing that miscarriage treatment and abortions both may require the same medical procedures. One obstetrician-gynecologist noted that both abortion and miscarriage care are part of the full spectrum of reproductive health care that people need access to:   Abortion care is miscarriage care. They go together and you cannot really provide one without the other. And obviously, women who have a miscarriage, that is like one of the worst times in their entire lives. And now we are making that even harder. So, women really need to have their own autonomy and be able to make decisions [in consultation with their doctors].  (18)  Clinicians described distress experienced by their pregnant patients unable to receive care, and their own distress from being unable to care for patients and uphold medical ethics  Many clinicians described the frustration, distress, and anger their patients are experiencing. One obstetrician-gynecologist said of the six-week ban,  I have had a few patients, it is very few, which is surprising to me, who are just angry at me because they need to be angry at somebody. And I just take it because I know that they are angry and I am angry, too.  (7) Another obstetrician-gynecologist said,  There is a lot of crying and there is a lot of you know, the amount of people that tell me that  I almost died last time [I was pregnant], what am I supposed to do now?  is just alarming.  (21)  Clinicians discussed how hard it was to communicate to patients that they will have to travel out of state for their abortion care:   As a doctor, you watch these patients process all of this, like, in real time, and they are all kinds of frustrated. They are confused. A couple of them ended up at some legalized harassment clinic [anti-abortion centers that try to dissuade pregnant people from having abortions] that they thought was going to provide them abortion services, and it did not and wasted their time. And they need help, and financially, they need help. Just the whole idea of transportation, a lot of them already have kids. How do they make this work? It is really urgent. And they are really vocally very frustrated.  (20)  One clinician at an abortion-providing facility described a clinic visit after the current abortion ban with a pregnant patient from Vietnam:   I was trying to explain to her that she was like, eight weeks or something like that. And she pleaded with me, and she started to cry, and I said,  I cannot do anything. It is illegal.  And she said,  Just sell me the medication under the table.  And I am like,  I cannot do that.  And then she fainted in my office, and we had to revive her, and I felt really bad, and she kept [saying]  Please, I cannot have this baby. Please help me. Please help me.  You know, what do you do? You just have to be as understanding and supportive as possible. But I am not going to violate the law.  (9)  Several clinicians described the reactions of pregnant patients who did not know about the abortion ban until they requested an abortion at a clinic visit with them:   When you have to tell them that it is not available to them in their state, their frustration turns on us. Like, we had a patient [say],  I cannot believe that. Like, you are telling me that I cannot get [an abortion]?  And we were like,  You should go out and vote in November, because, we did not make this decision, and we agree with you. You should be allowed [to have an abortion].  So, I have definitely had the animosity of patients who maybe either knew about the laws, but it did not affect them or who did not even know that these laws were being put in place until it affected them and being really frustrated by it.  (19)  Multiple clinicians in hospitals that required them to complete the 24-hour consent paperwork with patients who were experiencing medical emergencies or fatal fetal diagnoses described how distressful this was for their patients and them. One clinician explained that her hospital required this as an extra precaution to make sure they were complying with state law and told us:   [The state-mandated 24-hour consent] form is really painful to go through with patients… It basically says, I have been given the opportunity to view a live ultrasound image of my baby, and they have shown me specifically the heartbeat. Or like, I have been given materials and gone over materials for adoption or, you know, like, quote unquote, alternatives to proceeding through with the pregnancy. And it is a difficult conversation, especially instances where, like, the parent may not actually want to go through with having a termination of pregnancy but medically, it is in their best interest. Like, we got a transfer from an outside hospital one time for this lady who had presented to that outside hospital for a heart failure exacerbation. She was very sick from her heart failure and found out in that admission in the ED there that she was pregnant with twins at like, 16 weeks. …. She has an extremely high chance of dying just from the pregnancy. And even at this conservative, religious outside hospital that she was at, the MFM there told her that she needs to go somewhere that will help her end her pregnancy. So, they transfer her to us, of course…. And she understood. She was very much on board with, like,  I want to be pregnant, but I also want to be there for my five other children and my partner.  And it is hard to just have that conversation with a patient, let alone after that conversation be like, now, here is this form where we are going to talk about all these things that are going to make you feel bad about making the right decision for yourself and your family right now.  (16)  Clinicians stated that the ban violated their overall medical ethics and that they experienced moral distress by not being able to provide the full range of reproductive health care options for patients. One clinician told us:   Basically, what we are being asked to do with these bans is throw out everything we have learned, our judgment, our clinical decision making, patient-centered care, advocacy, equitable health care, autonomy, and beneficence. We are basically being asked to throw every tenet of medicine out the window, and for me, abortion care is health care. It is the highest level of compassion and care and love that you can give to someone. …I am being told I cannot be a doctor, and if I want to be a doctor, I will go to prison for five years. It just puts patients in horrible situations that you would not wish upon your worst enemy. And that you definitely would never, ever want to go through yourself or have someone that you loved or cared about go through.  (11)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist said:   I can provide [abortion care] up to essentially 24 weeks. I have the skills to do that. It feels, again, dumb. Like, so stupid that I have to go into six weeks, one day patient and be like, yeah, I cannot do anything. We have to help you get out of state…. Especially when, you know, there is no medical reason for it. There is no other field of medicine where people are like, oh, sorry, I cannot do your colonoscopy or whatever, because I just cannot. And that is tough on all [the doctors at her facility]. I think everyone has the skills. We cannot use them. We have the knowledge; we know it is safe. And so, you are turning people away for no real reason except to avoid going to jail, which is crazy.  (23)  An obstetrician-gynecologist described succinctly the conflicts she and other reproductive health care providers face between adhering both with Florida s laws and her medical ethical obligations to her patients:   I tend to err on the side of, if I do not comply with the law, then I cannot help the next patient that needs this help. But it is a hard situation to be in just trying to do what is legal but also do what is right. It is not always the same thing.  (24)  Florida s abortion ban is exacerbating maternal health and mortality due to impacts on training new clinicians and trained clinicians leaving the state  Clinicians involved with medical student and resident training described how the inability to provide training in abortion care is detrimental to the future of maternal health care in the state. Several obstetrician-gynecologists told us stories about how the lack of comprehensive abortion training impacts the provision of broader reproductive health care and noted that this problem pre-dates the Dobbs decision. One obstetrician-gynecologist explained that the lack of providers trained in D&E procedures was already a problem in Florida before the abortion ban and that this shortage would likely worsen if current residents did not receive training in Florida:   I have graduated a large number of residents who end up staying somewhere in the area and they all inevitably end up calling me, [saying]  I have this stillbirth at 20 weeks. She has a previa and three sections. She is really not a candidate for an induction.  And they are going to section her. What, you are going to cut this woman open at 20 weeks? Like literally you are going to just split her uterus in half for no good reason. But this is what is being done to everybody across the state because nobody knows how to remove a fetus through the vagina anymore.  (21)  This is a problem as D&E procedures are important to broader obstetrics and gynecology practice. As one clinician stated:  Even if you decide you are never going to provide abortion care, you are going to be in a situation where you are going to need to evacuate a pregnant uterus at 14 to 16 weeks. And it is essential that you know this.  (7)  Clinicians further noted that trainees and established reproductive health care providers are choosing to leave the state and thus are further exacerbating existing shortages of providers. In the words of one obstetrician-gynecologist:  We are seeing providers leave. We are seeing residents not apply to the state of Florida because they want that training.  (10) Another obstetrician-gynecologist told us:   We are going to lose doctors. There is zero question. And what is interesting as well, you know, the state might say,  Well, good riddance of abortion providers like, we do not want you, we do not need you.  But I am talking about general obstetrician-gynecologists, MFMs who are like, I cannot provide the care and the counseling I need to understand these laws. I am going to leave. And we already have a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Florida.  (11)  Several clinicians emphasized the adverse effects of the abortion ban on training for miscarriage management. As an obstetrician-gynecologist explained:   One in three women in their lifetime will have a miscarriage. One of three pregnancies end in miscarriage. And so many people can be affected by this because the medical term for miscarriage is spontaneous abortion. And people writing these laws are not looking at the medical terminology, the medical understanding. At the end of the day, if we are not training our clinicians to be able to care for patients, for the one in three pregnancies needing this kind of care, hopefully not all of them need surgical intervention. But if we are not able to train our providers to safely provide this care, we are doing a huge disservice to the state of Florida.  (10)  Additionally, obstetrician-gynecologists described the negative impacts the abortion ban will have on maternal health and mortality overall in Florida, a state that already had poor maternal health outcomes.   You, the bearer of the uterus, are 14 times more likely to die from being pregnant and delivering full term than from having an abortion. 14 times more likely to die. Forget hemorrhage, psychiatric dysfunction, infections, lacerations. I am not talking about morbidity. I am talking about mortality. And that is based on a study of a maternal mortality ratio of 8.8 to 100,000. Florida is in the low twenties. And that is even worse for people of color. So, we are actively condemning people to death by instituting these bans. And I feel like nobody understands this. Why are we trying to make our mothers die? That makes no sense. And I promise you that both Republican and Democratic mothers will die because this is not a partisan issue. This is medicine. …You need to be on alarm about the kind of training your doctor is getting because there are simply no doctors who can do this anymore. And the entire public should be alarmed because when a bad and weird and an unexpected thing happens in your pregnancy, your doctor will not know how to help you. And that is alarming.  (21)  Florida s abortion ban interferes with individual freedom to access health care  When asked what they wished people knew about Florida s abortion ban, many clinicians emphasized that the abortion ban interferes with individual freedom to access reproductive health care. International human rights law recognized that legal restrictions on abortion can violate numerous human rights, including the rights to life, health, equality, freedom from torture and cruelty, and reproductive autonomy.[54] The World Health Organization has found that the criminalization and penalization of abortion care – even with an exception for medical necessity – is fundamentally inconsistent with evidence-based, ethical, and patient-centered health care.[55] In the words of one Florida obstetrician-gynecologist:  It is really interfering in something that should never get interfered with, which is somebody s private health care.  Another obstetrician-gynecologist said:   I think I would like the public to see that abortion care is part of pregnancy care and basic health care. And when it comes to basic health care decisions, Floridians and Americans deserve the right to make these private medical decisions based on science within the context and support of their health care team and without politicians telling them what to do. That is the key thing. I would almost argue that it is not about abortion. You can choose to have an abortion, you can choose to continue the pregnancy and parent, you can choose to continue the pregnancy and make an adoption plan. It is about privacy and choice for your family and your body. Abortion is a part of that, but it is about the fundamental right to choice and privacy.  (2)  Several physicians emphasized the importance of recognizing the manifold physical harms of this governmental interference in private medical decisions between pregnant patients and their physicians. In the words of one obstetrician-gynecologist:   Being able to provide this type of care without the fear of not only affecting your patient, but your institution, your own license, it goes a very long way. And that this care that we are providing is lifesaving. I just feel like people have such a limited perception of what abortion care is and having seen the scary side of people being denied it, it is scary. And I am thankful that some people do not have to know the reality of that, but I sometimes wish that they did know the reality of the implications of limiting this.  (25)  Another obstetrician-gynecologist discussed how the bans on abortion also impact other reproductive health care, like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and contraception:   There is fear in the IVF community that fertility treatments will be the next to be banned because at the end of the day, whether it is abortion, fertility treatments, or contraception, it is all about bodily autonomy. Do women have autonomy over their own bodies? Who has control? It is clearly not about supporting families and children, because if you wanted families, then you would let IVF happen because that is creating more lives.  (10)  Multiple clinicians also discussed that they wanted people to know that abortion care is safe and should not be restricted through criminal bans. One obstetrician-gynecologist told us:   Abortion is really safe, and there is this strange misconception that it is dangerous, but the risks of an abortion are lower than the risks of pregnancy at baseline. It is medical care, and we should not be restricting any type of medical procedure.  (17)  Conclusion  The findings of this research brief illustrate the urgent need to reverse Florida s abortion ban and restore decision-making on individual health care to patients in consultation with their health care providers. The health care providers interviewed by PHR described multiple adverse effects of Florida s abortion ban on pregnant people s health, well-being, and human rights. They reported delays and denials of reproductive health care including in medical emergencies, deviations from standard medical care, disruption of the patient-clinician relationship, the need for patients to seek care outside of Florida, negative impacts on training new clinicians and retention of health care providers in the state, and adverse effects on individual freedom and bodily autonomy. Social determinants of health and racial and ethnic disparities significantly exacerbate these issues for many women in the state of Florida.  Florida s current abortion ban has broadly impaired physicians  ability to provide the proper standard of health care. Even the narrow exceptions to the ban have proven unworkable in practice, due to the confusion caused by non-medical terminology in the laws and fear arising from the significant penalties for violations of the ban. While physicians do continue to provide care where allowable under state law, the current abortion ban affords patients only a very narrow time frame to identify the pregnancy and access abortion care before five weeks and five days after the first day of a patient s last menstrual period, the last day to make the first abortion appointment to be seen at six weeks with Florida s 24-hour waiting period. Patients who receive severe fetal diagnoses later in pregnancy that are not deemed  imminently lethal  upon delivery are not able to receive abortion care in Florida and are being forced to leave the state for that care.  Furthermore, the fear of punishment for violating Florida s abortion law by providing care to patients who are not experiencing an immediate risk of death has led clinicians to feel unable to provide treatment until patients develop additional health complications. Multiple clinicians at rural or religiously affiliated hospitals discussed having to refer patients to tertiary care centers for medical emergencies, due to hospital concerns about providing abortion care under Florida s current laws. This included referring cases of miscarriage management and patients with conditions that were deemed exempt from Florida s abortion ban.  These accounts demonstrate the extreme chilling effect caused by Florida s unclear, punitive, and sweeping abortion ban on the provision of reproductive health care. Clinicians stated that Florida s unworkable medical exceptions are leading to widespread fear and confusion that significantly threatens Floridians  ability to access even routine medical care and jeopardizes their health and well-being. Clinicians stated that the abortion ban limits an individual s reproductive freedom to make decisions about their reproductive health care. They reported feeling anguish that their inability to provide their patients with options for the full spectrum of standard medical care constituted a violation of their medical ethics and professional obligations to their patients. Many clinicians told us that they were considering leaving Florida and mentioned their colleagues who had already left the state due to this governmental infringement on their practice of medicine. They also expressed concerns about the impacts of the ban on training for residents and medical students, who need sufficient training in D&C and D&E procedures not just for abortion provision, but also for miscarriage management and emergency care later in pregnancy.  These concerns highlight that the state s abortion ban has adverse consequences not just for the current landscape of abortion access but also for health care more broadly in Florida. It is essential to remedy the insurmountable barriers to care and devastating harm to Floridians caused by the state s extreme abortion restrictions. Health care providers must be able to again meet their professional obligations to provide comprehensive reproductive health care for their patients, including termination of pregnancy.

Dilation and Curettage (D&C): A procedure in which the cervix is opened (dilated) and a thin instrument is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue from inside the uterus (curettage). It is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including for first-trimester abortion or after a miscarriage to remove all pregnancy tissue.  Dilation and Evacuation (D&E): The most common method of abortion after about 14 weeks pregnancy in which the cervix is opened (dilated) and the contents of the uterus are removed (evacuated) using instruments and a suction device. It is also a common procedure used after a miscarriage to remove all pregnancy tissue.  Ectopic pregnancy: A pregnancy in a place other than the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube.  Family Medicine: A medical specialty within primary care that provides continuing and comprehensive health care for the individual and family across all ages, genders, diseases, and parts of the body, including obstetric care.

Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialist: Also known as a perinatologist, an obstetrician-gynecologist with additional training in caring for pregnant patients with high-risk pregnancies.  Medical management of miscarriage: There are three main treatments for early pregnancy loss aimed at removing any pregnancy tissue left in the uterus: expectant management (letting the tissue pass on its own); medication; or a procedure (dilation and curettage).  Medication abortion: The use of medications to induce abortion. The World Health Organization endorses two regimens: one is the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol and the other uses misoprostol alone.  Obstetrics-gynecology (ob-gyn): The medical specialty that encompasses the two subspecialties of obstetrics (care of pregnant patients) and gynecology which focus on reproductive health and pregnancy. These clinicians are often called  ob-gyns  and the specialty of obstetrics is often called  OB.   Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM): A condition where the pregnant person s amniotic sac (bag of water) breaks prior to 37 weeks  gestation and prior to the onset of labor. Delivery occurs within one week of PPROM in 50 percent of patients.  Qualitative research: A type of research that gathers and analyzes nonnumerical data in order to gain an understanding of individuals  social reality, including understanding their perceptions of their experiences, attitudes, beliefs, and motivations.  Self-managed abortion: Where a pregnant person performs their own abortion outside the formal health care system.  Spontaneous abortion: Also called a miscarriage, it is the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks  gestation.  Standard of care: Treatment that is accepted by medical experts as the most appropriate for a certain type of disease in a particular setting and is widely used by health care professionals.

4,41,Vox,Kamala Harris and Oprah humanized the consequences of state abortion bans,,https://www.vox.com/abortion/373133/kamala-harris-oprah-winfrey-michigan-amber-thurman-abortion-bans-democrats,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris attended a town hall style forum hosted by Oprah Winfrey in Michigan Thursday night. Harris received questions on most of the 2024 campaign cycle s top issues, including guns and immigration — but a segment on abortion proved to be an emotional centerpiece that has continued to generate conversation.  That moment largely focused on a 28-year-old Black woman from Georgia named Amber Thurman, featured in a recent ProPublica report. Thurman died in August 2022 after doctors hesitated to treat her following a complication from a medication abortion.  After that year s Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization, which overturned the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, Georgia implemented a strict abortion law that severely limited the abortion-related care available to anyone more than six weeks pregnant.  Thurman was at least nine weeks pregnant; state law allows Georgia doctors to perform the procedure she required — a dilation and curettage, or D&C — only when the mother s life is in danger. Doing so before then could result in a doctor going to prison for up to 10 years. At the time, the hospital reportedly had no guidance or policy in place about how to navigate the law and ascertain whether a pregnant person s life was in danger. However, the ProPublica report suggests Thurman s doctors waited too long — 20 hours after she went to her local hospital — before beginning to operate on her.  A state review found Thurman s death was  preventable,  and that s a theme her family stressed as they spoke with Harris and Winfrey.   They just let her die because of some stupid abortion ban,  Thurman s older sister said.  They treated her like she was just another number.   Harris offered her condolences to Thurman s family, and used the moment to argue that Thurman s story underscores the need for a change for greater abortion rights — as well as the sort of abortion policy Democrats are running on.  Democrats are running on expanding abortion rights  In the wake of Dobbs, more than a dozen states have passed strict abortion bans; nearly a dozen others, including Georgia, have laws that severely limit who is able to access an abortion.  Georgia s law, the LIFE Act, was initially passed in 2019 and upheld last year. It outlaws abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detectable, something that usually occurs around five or six weeks of gestation. It does allow abortions past that point for  medical emergencies,  but is vague about when doctors should declare an emergency, other than defining them as a  condition in which an abortion is necessary in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.   In many states, there have been efforts to overturn abortion laws — or keep them from being instituted. In Michigan, where the town hall was held, voters enshrined the right to abortion into the state s constitution in 2023. In the wake of Dobbs, ballot initiatives to protect abortion access in Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Vermont, Montana, and California all passed. And this year, a new slate of states will decide whether to protect access.   There are 10 states with ballot initiatives for this November,  said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who focuses on gender and abortion access.  Five of those states would change the current law in that state … going from [ending] a complete abortion ban [in] South Dakota and Missouri, to alleviating a six-week ban in Florida, a 15-week ban in Arizona, and a 12-week ban in Nebraska.   Democrats have tied themselves to these initiatives, hoping that they boost turnout. The party successfully campaigned on abortion in the 2022 midterms, and made abortion a factor in several special elections that were Democratic wins. They hope to make the issue a central part of this year s election too. According to the Pew Research Center, abortion is a top five issue for Democratic voters, and a top 10 issue for voters overall.  Harris has repeatedly attacked former President Donald Trump as being responsible for the end of Roe, arguing as she did Thursday,  The former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade — and they did as he intended.   Harris, meanwhile, has said that, as president, she would approve federal legislation protecting the right to abortion. The current model for that legislation is the 2023 Women s Health Protection Act, which would prevent state governments from imposing restrictions on abortion rights pre-viability. (Of course, Harris would probably need a Democratic majority in both the House and Senate — which currently seems unlikely — for federal abortion protections to pass.)  For his part, Trump has bragged about being the president who overturned Roe, and has argued that abortion policy should be left to the states. He has said he would not approve a federal abortion ban if given another term. He has also sought to distance himself from Project 2025, the conservative vision for the US that includes draconian restrictions on women s health care, rights, and freedom.  But that s not to say that a second Trump term couldn t make even abortion more difficult to access, including through the method he used the first time around: court appointments."
4,42,Colorado Public Radio,"Frisch, Hurd press each other on abortion, campaign tactics in first debate",,https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/22/frisch-hurd-congressional-district-three-debate-club-20/,"In their first official meeting, the two men running for Colorado s 3rd Congressional District grappled over abortion and campaign tactics, while demonstrating some alignment on key issues.  Third Congressional District candidates Adam Frisch, a Democrat from Aspen, and Republican Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction squared off Saturday night. The debate was held in Grand Junction and sponsored by Club 20, an advocacy organization for Colorado s Western Slope.  During the cross examination portion of the evening, in which candidates are afforded five minutes to question each other, Frisch asked Hurd how he would vote on Amendment 79, an issue on this November s ballot that would guarantee a right to abortion in Colorado s constitution.   I m running for federal office, but I would say, consistently, my view when it comes to the issue of abortion, I m pro-life with exceptions, but I fundamentally believe that this is an issue that should be left to the states,  Hurd said.   You don t want federal politicians overriding a woman s health care decisions, but you re okay with the state politicians doing it?  Frisch countered.  Frisch also pressed Hurd on whether he voted for Lauren Boebert in 2022 — Hurd said he does not reveal who he votes for — and if Hurd would reject the support of former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who backs Hurd and who is also a part of a project that seeks to pump water from Southern Colorado into the Denver area. Frisch has raised the connection between Hurd and Owens to suggest that Hurd would not be a protector of water in the southern portion of the 3rd Congressional District.   Governor Owens and I may not agree on every issue, but I m proud to have his support,  Hurd said, adding that he also has the backing of Colorado state Sen. Cleave Simpson, who represents the region.  For his part, Hurd used the majority of his cross-examination time to press Frisch on a primary campaign strategy that saw Frisch spending money on ads that appeared to elevate Ron Hanks, a more extreme candidate who finished second in the Republican primary race.  Hurd specifically pointed to a Colorado Sun article about Frisch s campaign running television ads during the primary campaign.   The subtitle (of the article) said  The ads attack Grand Junction attorney Jeff Hurd in a clear call to GOP primary voters in the district to back someone else in the six-way Republican primary -- someone Adam Frisch believes will be easier to beat in November.  Is that accurate reporting?  Hurd asked  Frisch said that framing in the article was  editorializing  and that his campaign s spending in the primary was in anticipation of facing either Hanks or Hurd in the general election. He also said he stands by one of the attacks in the ad, that Hurd was avoiding debates and public events.   You skipped your own Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce on Monday.  You have another scheduling conflict,   Frisch said, making air quotation marks with his fingers,  Why are you so scared to make sure that people outside of your own small curated group, how come you don t want to talk to them?   Hurd went on to question Frisch on the same issue, asking if he d asked for the story to be corrected or why he d stopped running that television ad. Eventually, Hurd pivoted to speaking to the audience rather than Frisch, asking who they trusted more.   Do you believe what Adam Frisch is saying? I think it would be easier and more honest if he just admitted,  yeah, I thought your opponent would be easier to beat. And so I supported him,   Hurd said.  The sparring back-and-forth stood in contrast to the structured debate questions, in which the pair showed little daylight between their policy positions on water, energy and public lands use.  On inflation, Hurd pointed to the federal budget.   You go to Chick-fil-A nowadays, you pay $50, or you fill up your grocery cart with barely nothing and you re spending a hundred dollars. Why is that? Because we have too much spending. Our federal government is spending too much money,  Hurd said.  Frisch said both parties had a track record of spending beyond what was reasonable, but said corporate consolidation, particularly in agriculture, was to blame.   The agricultural industry, as farmers know now compared to where they were 30, 40 years ago, they have a lot fewer options of which to sell their goods,  Frisch said.  In 1980, the average farmer was taking home about 30 cents of every dollar that was spent. It s now down to under 9 cents.   Both candidates said they re running because they feel the 3rd Congressional District has been left behind. In response to a question about how to retain and attract workers, Frisch said leaders need to bring down the cost of housing and childcare and fund health care job training.   We also need to figure out how to increase the supply of health care so people feel comfortable in starting businesses in the Western slope, pushing back against the shrinking of health care supply in rural parts of our country, especially Colorado,  Frisch said.  Hurd added that government regulation was restricting job growth, and drew the attention to the top of the Democratic ticket.   It s important that we stand with the small businesses of Main Street, not Wall Street Democrats like President (Joe) Biden, Vice President (Kamala) Harris, who ve never run a business, by the way,  Hurd said.  Regardless of the outcome of November s election, residents of Colorado s 3rd Congressional District will have a new representative. Rep. Boebert, the incumbent, opted late last year to move to Colorado s 4th District.  Ballots for the November election will begin mailing out Oct. 11."
4,43,The Conversation,Abortion rights are on 10 state ballots in November − Democrats can’t count on this to win elections for them,,https://theconversation.com/abortion-rights-are-on-10-state-ballots-in-november-democrats-cant-count-on-this-to-win-elections-for-them-238373,"Ten states will vote on ballot initiatives on abortion this November: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Nevada and South Dakota.  Many political analysts and pundits view abortion as a partisan issue, fueling speculation that direct votes on abortion rights will boost Democrats  chances up and down the ballot in November. Some Democratic strategists are hoping that turnout from the ballot initiatives will swing elections away from Republican candidates in key states such as Arizona, Nevada and Florida.  But the effects that ballot measures have on which candidates win or lose is rarely so straightforward.  For the past three years, my work as a political sociologist has been cataloging and studying ballot initiatives. Based on state-level data and recent trends, I believe it is highly likely that many of November s ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights will pass. But that will not necessarily translate into broader Democratic candidate victories.  The wave of abortion rights votes  The U.S. Supreme Court overturned half a century of federal abortion protections in June 2022, sending the question of whether and when people can get an abortion back to individual states to decide. Republican legislators in Kansas quickly seized the opportunity and rushed a referendum enabling them to ban abortion onto the August 2022 primary ballot.  It backfired. Despite being majority Republican, almost 60% of Kansas voters rejected the abortion ban.  In 2022 and 2023, voters in six more states protected abortion rights with ballot initiatives. Kentucky and Montana voters rejected abortion bans, while California, Michigan, Ohio and Vermont voted to codify abortion rights in their state constitutions, all through ballot measures.  Ballot initiatives are nonpartisan  Ballot initiatives – also called propositions, measures, referendums and more – refer to votes on a policy instead of a politician. In some states, voters can put initiatives on the ballot by gathering signatures. In all states except one – Delaware – state legislators can put issues directly before voters in the form of a referendum. In other instances, such as amending most state constitutions, decisions must go to a popular vote.  The media often portrays U.S. politics through a polarized, two-party lens. Ballot initiatives do not necessarily fit the mold. Ballot initiative votes on topics such as the minimum wage and Medicaid expansion show that some policies are popular across Democratic and Republican party affiliations. For example, raising the minimum wage is undefeated in 24 ballot initiatives at the state level since 1996, including in traditionally conservative, liberal and swing states.  The state ballots that wound up serving wins on abortion rights since 2022 reflect a similar dynamic. The issue is polarizing, but not down the middle and not strictly along party lines. Nationwide polls show long-standing majority support for abortion rights, including among many Republicans.  Inconclusive at best  There is research indicating that ballot initiatives can increase voter turnout. However, most studies show mixed results and limited effects.  Looking at turnout numbers in the 2022 and 2023 state elections that had votes on abortion rights, and comparing them with those same states  previous election numbers, we don t see compelling evidence for the ballot measures bringing out more voters.  Michigan and Vermont had increased turnout in 2022, while voter numbers decreased in California, Kentucky and Montana.  Kansas in 2022 and Ohio in 2023 both saw voter gains, but those votes are poor comparisons, because they took place in a primary and an odd-year election, respectively, when turnout tends to be low.  Ballot initiatives on abortion rights, whether to codify or ban them, also appear to have little impact on partisan elections. After defeating the abortion ban in August 2022, Kansas voters went on to reelect both the Democratic incumbent governor and a Republican incumbent senator that November. Kansas House seats remained unchanged, with Republicans holding a supermajority.  In Kentucky and Montana, a majority of voters rejected abortion bans in 2022 and continued to elect Republicans to state office. In Michigan, Democrats took control of the state Legislature in 2022 alongside the state s vote for abortion rights.  It is possible that Michigan s  blue wave  in 2022 got a boost from the state s ballot initiative to protect abortion rights that year. However, it likely had more to do with direct legislation from the previous election. In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot initiative to create an independent redistricting commission that undid years of gerrymandering that had benefited Republicans. These redrawn maps were first used in 2022.  Most importantly, just because a voter cares deeply about abortion rights does not necessarily mean they will vote for Democrats. Republican women voters overwhelmingly support the right to abortion in all states.  Meanwhile, about 6% of voters chose  uncommitted  in Nevada s 2024 Democratic primary, in line with the national uncommitted movement in solidarity with Palestinians. This political movement advocates withholding support for Democrats over the Biden administration s support for Israel s war in Gaza. Those voters are highly likely to support the state s abortion initiative in November but may not be persuaded to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris or other Democrats.  Democrats can t rely on abortion ballot initiatives  Ballot initiatives are about specific issues, not political candidates. In this case, the issue of abortion rights has more nationwide support than the Democratic Party does.  If Democratic politicians want to win in November – from Harris and Tim Walz to state and local candidates – they will need to persuade voters based on their merits compared with their Republican counterparts. They can t count on abortion initiatives to win the 2024 election for them."
4,44,The New York Times,Harris Slams G.O.P. Abortion Bans as a Painful ‘Health Care Crisis’,,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/harris-gop-abortion-bans-health-care-crisis.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris delivered an impassioned speech about abortion rights on Friday in Georgia, accusing Republicans who support abortion bans of causing unnecessary suffering as she described the far-reaching, painful and even deadly consequences of such policies.   These hypocrites want to start talking about,  This is in the best interests of women and children,   Ms. Harris said in Atlanta as she denounced both abortion bans and the struggles some women face in order to receive proper care during and after their pregnancies.  Well, where you been? Where you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America? Where you been? How dare they?   Ms. Harris s speech in Georgia, a top battleground state where she has narrowly trailed in polls, signaled a more combative and nimble approach in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign. On Monday, ProPublica reported that the deaths of two women in the state were a result of delayed treatment after receiving medication abortions, episodes that occurred in the months after Georgia passed a 2022 law banning abortion at six weeks. Two days later, Ms. Harris s campaign announced that she would travel to the state to highlight their stories.   This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis,  Ms. Harris said to the crowd of roughly 600 people at a performing arts center in Cobb County, an area that has flipped from a Republican stronghold to safely Democratic territory. She described tragic outcomes linked to abortion restrictions as both preventable and predictable, and expressed outrage and indignation at the way that she said women seeking abortion care were treated.  Women are  being made to feel as though they did something wrong,  she said, adding:  The judgment factor here is outrageous. Being made as though — to feel as though they are criminals, as though they are alone.    We see you,  she said.  You are not alone.   As Ms. Harris and Democrats have pushed relentlessly to place abortion rights at the center of the election, they have sought to blame Mr. Trump for appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, a decision that paved the way for restrictive state abortion laws like the one in Georgia. During her remarks, Ms. Harris seemed to mock Mr. Trump s claim that he supported exceptions for the woman s health, and she criticized the idea of providing medical care only before a woman might die, calling it inhumane policy.

The Democrat unleashed one of the most forceful speeches of her campaign so far as she blamed Trump for an abortion ban in the battleground state of Georgia that she said had caused the deaths of two women.   And these hypocrites want to start talking about how this is in the best interest of women and children,  the vice president told a rally in Atlanta, Georgia to cheers from a mainly female audience.   Well, where have you been? Where have you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America, where have you been? How dare they.   Since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket two months ago, Harris has repeatedly focused on what she calls  Trump abortion bans.   Trump has frequently bragged on the campaign trail that his three Supreme Court picks paved the way for the 2022 overturning of the national right to abortion.  Read moreAbortions have increased in US since Roe v. Wade repeal, study shows  At least 20 states have since brought in full or partial restrictions, with Georgia banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.  Harris doubled down on the issue later Friday at a raucous rally in Madison, a liberal-leaning city in swing state Wisconsin where she slammed the bans as  immoral.    This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect.   In both speeches Harris mentioned Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old mother-of-one from Georgia who developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in 2022.  An official Georgia state committee blamed the fatal outcome on a  preventable  lag in performing a critical procedure.   We will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic,  Harris said in Atlanta, a day after meeting Thurman s family during a campaign event hosted by talkshow icon Oprah Winfrey.  Read moreUS woman died after abortion law delayed urgent medical care   Excited   Harris s campaign speeches came as three states -- Virginia, Minnesota and South Dakota -- began early voting 46 days before election day in what is an agonizingly close race.   The election is basically here,  she told Madison rallygoers.  It s basically here and we have work to do, to energize, to organize and to mobilize.   Former president Trump has previously cast doubt on early voting and mail voting to back his false claims that he won the 2020 election against Biden.  Most US states permit in-person voting or mail-in voting to allow people to deal with scheduling conflicts or an inability to cast their ballots on election day itself, November 5.  Dozens of people waited at a polling station in the center of Arlington, Virginia, just outside the capital Washington.   I m excited,  said Michelle Kilkenny, 55, adding that voting early,  especially on day one, helps the campaign and raises the enthusiasm level.   Ann Spiker, 71, told AFP she usually cast her ballot by mail  but I m going to vote today because it s so exciting.   The Democratic supporter added:  I can t believe we can pick Donald Trump, when I think about it I become very worried. That s why we re out and doing what we can.   Trump, 78, faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.   Abhorrent   Every vote will count in the race, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept.  Harris, 59, has erased Trump s lead since sensationally replacing Biden as the Democratic candidate in July, pulling neck-and-neck with the Republican.  The result is expected to hinge on just seven crucial swing states, including Georgia and Wisconsin.  Trump however sought to lay the blame for any potential loss at the door of Jewish American voters, sparking outrage on Friday.   If I don t win this election... in my opinion the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss,  Trump told an anti-Semitism event on Thursday, repeating his grievance that Jewish voters have historically leaned towards the Democrats.  The White House slammed his comments.   It is abhorrent to traffic in dangerous tropes or engage in scapegoating at any time -- let alone now, when all leaders have an obligation to fight back against the tragic worldwide rise in anti-Semitism,  White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement.

4,46,"ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos",State asks judge to pause ruling that struck down North Dakota's abortion ban,,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/state-asks-judge-pause-ruling-struck-north-dakotas-113845999,"BISMARCK, N.D. -- The state of North Dakota is asking a judge to pause his ruling from last week that struck down the state s abortion ban until the state Supreme Court rules on a planned appeal.  The state s motion to stay a pending appeal was filed Wednesday. State District Judge Bruce Romanick ruled last week that North Dakota s abortion ban  is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,  and that pregnant women in the state have a fundamental right to abortion before viability under the state constitution.  Attorneys for the state said  a stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues.   In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to an abortion. Soon afterward, the only abortion clinic in North Dakota moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, and challenged North Dakota s since-repealed trigger ban outlawing most abortions.  In 2023, North Dakota s Republican-controlled Legislature revised the state s abortion laws amid the ongoing lawsuit. The amended ban outlawed performance of all abortions as a felony crime but for procedures to prevent a pregnant woman s death or a  serious health risk  to her, and in cases of rape or incest but only up to six weeks. The law took effect in April 2023.  The Red River Women s Clinic, joined by several doctors, then challenged that law as unconstitutionally vague for doctors and its health exception as too narrow. In court in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, the state asked the judge to throw out the lawsuit, while the plaintiffs asked him to let the August trial proceed. He canceled the trial and later found the law unconstitutional, but has yet to issue a final judgment.  In an interview Tuesday, Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said the plaintiffs would oppose any stay.   Look, they don t have to appeal, and they also don t have to seek a stay because, like I said, this decision is not leading any time soon to clinics reopening across the state,  he said.  We re talking about standard-of-care, necessary, time-sensitive health care, abortion care generally provided in hospitals or by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and for the state to seek a stay or to appeal a ruling that allows those physicians just to practice medicine I think is shameful.   Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 bill, said she s confident the state Supreme Court will overturn the judge s ruling. She called the decision one of the poorest legal decisions she has read.   I challenge anybody to go through his opinion and find anything but  personal opinions,   she said Monday.  In his ruling, Romanick said,  The Court is left to craft findings and conclusions on an issue of vital public importance when the longstanding precedent on that issue no longer exists federally, and much of the North Dakota precedent on that issue relied on the federal precedent now upended — with relatively no idea how the appellate court in this state will address the issue.

4,48,The 19th News,Abortion is quietly driving the voting conversation in Georgia — even if it isn’t on the ballot,,https://19thnews.org/2024/09/abortion-georgia-voters-harris-campaign/,"Your trusted source for contextualizing abortion and Election 2024 news. Sign up for our daily newsletter.  Callie Beale Harper was 37 when she found out she was pregnant with twins. Already the mom to a four-year-old son, she and her husband were so excited to grow their family, they opted for noninvasive prenatal testing as soon as it was available, at 10 weeks gestational age.  Two weeks later, they learned there was a 96 percent chance one of the twins had a chromosomal abnormality. A visit to a maternal-fetal specialist in Atlanta one week later confirmed their worst fears.  As soon as the ultrasound technician located her son in utero,  I immediately knew that so many things were wrong. His little body was incredibly swollen, completely filled with fluid, and that was honestly really painful to see, because I just hoped that he wasn t in pain,  Beale Harper told The 19th.  The doctor explained that there were multiple structural abnormalities that would make him  incompatible with life. There was no hope for him, as far as any number of surgeries he could have had to then be OK.  The doctor recommended a procedure known as selective reduction, when one of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy is terminated to better the chances of a healthy pregnancy and birth for the remaining fetuses. It is a form of abortion.  Beale Harper — who describes herself as a  lover of Jesus  and  great mom  — lives in Georgia, where such a procedure is illegal under the state s six-week abortion ban. And she knows there are others in the state like her — people who, for a wide variety of reasons, oppose the ban and feel motivated to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris because of it.  Georgia s constitution prohibits the kind of ballot initiatives that are popping up nationwide to codify abortion rights; for the existing six-week ban to be reversed, there would either have to be some kind of new federal law guaranteeing abortion access or a new bill passed by the Georgia legislature and signed into law by the governor. But for a broad and diverse coalition of Peach State voters, abortion is still on the ballot — a reality that seems evident to reproductive rights advocates (and opponents) in the state, as well as the Harris campaign, which is putting time and resources into keeping the issue front and center.   In every space that I ve walked into since Kamala Harris has been at the top of the ticket, abortion has been part of the discussion,  Democratic Georgia state Rep. Shea Roberts told The 19th.  So even though we can t do a citizen-led ballot initiative, these events are packed.   The campaign weighed in Sept. 17 on new reporting from ProPublica on the fatal impact of the ban.  This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down,  the vice president said in a released statement. The Harris campaign last month kicked off a 50-stop bus tour,  Fighting for Reproductive Freedom,  in battleground states. The tour made three stops in Georgia, just one week after the vice president herself held a rally in Savannah. Beale Harper met Harris during the Savannah rally and then shared her story with attendees at the bus-stop tour there the following week.  The platform provided by the vice president s campaign is only one way that regular Georgians like Beale Harper are serving as surrogates to connect with others in their community about their stories — and the upcoming election. Beale Harper is now reaching out to churches and church leaders across the state about why faith and reproductive freedom are not incompatible — and an important vote driver.  In a state that is religiously, racially and culturally diverse, some conversations are louder, some are quieter — but they are happening in public and private spaces alike as Georgians look for ways to vote their beliefs. Nearly 75 percent of Georgians — including 62 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats — do not want to see abortion criminalized before the point of fetal viability, according to respondents in a University of Maryland poll released on September 4. Nearly the same percentage of all voters — and 86 percent of Black voters — described banning abortion at six weeks as very or somewhat concerning in polling from last year conducted by Reproductive Freedom For All (formerly NARAL), an advocacy group that opposes restrictions to abortion.  Abortion is always on the ballot for Black women, but not as a standalone issue, according to Jara Butler, the chief impact officer for Supermajority, a progressive grassroots organization that focuses on mobilizing young women voters. She has previously worked for Georgians for Choice, a no-longer active group in the state that worked on coalition-building around reproductive freedom, specifically focused on organizing Black women, especially in rural parts of the state and within Black churches.   When we think about reproductive freedom, we really need to expand that to reproductive justice because for communities of color, especially Black women, it s about having access to information that will help you carry a pregnancy to term,  Butler said.  Abortion is a critical voting issue for Black women because  it doesn t matter what your socioeconomic status is — every time that you become pregnant, you risk your life and the life of your child,  she said.  This is all the more true for Black women outside of metro Atlanta, especially those in more rural parts of the state, according to Butler.   The less access you have to medical care, the more doctors are referring you to a city center for care — which means the less likely you are close to a hospital,  Butler said.  And if you have a high-risk pregnancy, where are you going to go?   Georgia is one of 10 states that has not fully expanded Medicaid, which limits not only local care and easy hospital access, but ways to pay for prenatal and postnatal care. Black women in rural Georgia, in particular, are concerned about not only what happens in regard to the care they can or cannot receive during pregnancy, but what happens once a new baby is born.   What we re hearing from the ground is that they are looking at this in totality — that abortion is an economic issue, that abortion is a public health issue, that abortion is a life or death issue,  Butler said.  What this means is Black women-led conversations within their own communities about the stakes in this election — and how abortion factors into them.   Black women have always had to advocate for ourselves,  she said.  We are talking to each other and we are having frank conversations, but we re also talking to the Black community as a whole. We re talking to Black men and saying,  You all need to listen to us because we want better outcomes for ourselves.    The galvanizing potential for Georgia voters who oppose the six-week ban (and related restrictions) has not been lost on state lawmakers.   You will notice that the Republican-majority legislature has really tried to restrict or block any further abortion restriction bills from coming up to the floor in the state legislature,  said Georgia state Rep. Michelle Au.  They have the majority — they could pass basically anything they want, but they know that they ve pushed it basically as far as it can go in Georgia. They know this is probably a losing issue for them.   She points to the way that bills restricting access to medication abortion and telemedicine have been stymied and blocked by the Republican-led legislature.  They know that the more we talk about abortion, the more they re going to lose. They don t want people to be talking about abortion when they go to the ballot box.   Roberts, who represents parts of the Sandy Springs and Buckhead communities of Atlanta, previously sponsored a bill to restore abortion access and allow Medicaid coverage. She wasn t even granted a chance for a hearing on her bill.  This is how much my Republican colleagues do not want to talk about the topic.   In her district, she finds that women are frequently — and loudly — talking about the loss of reproductive rights they ve experienced. Even without a ballot initiative, it is a topic that many of her constituents mention and organize around. Roberts, who went public with her own abortion story after Georgia s six-week ban went into effect in 2022, started a new political action committee, United for Georgia Women, this summer to invest in local candidates to attempt to flip more seats in the state legislature. She said 13 seats would need to flip to break the Republican trifecta.   With Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket, the energy is very high in Georgia, and I am really feeling confident that she is going to win Georgia,  she said, adding that she hopes this will translate to down-ballot races as well.  When door-knocking, Roberts still hears plenty of women telling her that life begins at conception or that they are concerned that if the six-week ban is overturned, pregnant people might choose to have abortions right before delivery.  She has also met many women who seem eager to talk, only to be joined by their husbands who say their wives aren t interested in speaking further.  Encounters like this are in part why  we re also trying to spread the message that when you get in the voting booth, it s you and you alone, and they re not going to know how you vote,  Roberts said.  Without an option for a ballot initiative, abortion-as-a-voting-issue is sometimes discussed privately rather than in large public forums, and one place these conversations are taking place is in hospitals.  As an anesthesiologist at an Atlanta hospital, Au said she s heard from numerous medical providers who are concerned about the environment that has been created for medical practice and patient care in the state as a result of the six-week ban.  Many  traditional Republican  colleagues at the hospital  have essentially been turned into Democrats not just because of the extremism they see with [former President Donald] Trump, but specifically related to reproductive health care access and the restrictions [the six-week ban] places on patient care,  she told The 19th.  In Georgia, this also means the threat of criminalization of doctors.   I think that is really, really scary to people,  Au said.  She said she is also hearing quiet concerns about the impacts of the state s abortion ban among her own constituents. Au represents Johns Creek, a northeastern suburb with a high percentage of AAPI voters.  Au said that she has heard from AAPI voters in her community, many of them first- and second-generation immigrants, that for them, abortion is a  purely medical issue,  as opposed to a religious or cultural one. For these voters,  it s perplexing to come to a country which espouses all these freedoms then to have this one very personal medical decision be dictated by the state.   Though cultural issues might keep these conversations out of the foreground, Au said that, privately, it is something voters routinely bring up with her.  These private conversations about abortion reflect the kind of long-standing cultural stigmas that can still exist in some parts of the state, according to Beale Harper.  In the South, there s a lot of judgment. People can t even tell their families about it,  she said.  At the end of August, she shared her abortion experience on social media. Five days later, she was face to face with Harris in Savannah. She said she hopes that publicly sharing her story in person and on political stages can help change the narrative and connect the dots for others.  Her own abortion story didn t end at her maternal-fetal specialist s office. Because of Georgia s abortion law, Beale Harper s doctor couldn t offer her referrals or help her research options. He said the state wouldn t allow him to do so.  Beale Harper ultimately made appointments in three different states, taking the advice of her physician s office not to cancel any of them until she had a successful procedure. She ultimately ended up going to a doctor in New York City whose first available appointment was four weeks out.  Last October, Beale Harper was overjoyed when she gave birth to a healthy baby girl at 27 weeks. But she also felt  outraged  thinking about the experience she had in accessing the health care she needed — and the pressure she felt to be ashamed of her choice. It was a choice she didn t feel conflicted about making, even as she mourned the loss of a child she wanted.  Countless women have reached out to Beale Harper since she shared her story. All more or less telling her the same thing: They are Christian women who for whatever reason needed — and received — abortions, and felt like they couldn t tell anyone. And they oppose Georgia s six-week ban."

4,50,The Guardian,Kamala Harris attacks Trump over ‘immoral’ abortion bans at Wisconsin rally,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/kamala-harris-trump-abortion-wisconsin,"Kamala Harris campaigned in Madison, Wisconsin, the deep blue capital of the state and college town that Democrats hope will turn out enough voters to turn the election in the presidential nominee s favor.   We know this is gonna be a tight race until the very end,  said Harris.  We are the underdog in this race, and we have some hard work ahead of us.   Wisconsin voters delivered razor-thin margins during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by about 22,000 votes, and in 2020 Joe Biden scraped by with just 20,000 more than Trump.  Polling in Wisconsin so far shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck. Three polls conducted this week underscore just how tight the race could be here: polling by AARP, Marist and Quinnipiac University suggest the race is virtually tied here, with Harris leading Trump by just one point in each.  On the trail, Harris has emphasized her support for abortion rights, a centerpiece of her campaign and a galvanizing issue for young voters.   It is immoral,  said Harris of the numerous abortion bans that were implemented after Roe v Wade was overturned.  Let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do.   Harris described meeting with the mother of a young woman who died of sepsis after being denied abortion care in Georgia.   Amber Nicole Thurman,  said Harris.  I promised her mother I would say her name every time.   Whoever wins Wisconsin s popular vote earns the state s full 10 electoral votes, giving the state a disproportionate say over the presidential election, and groups such as Madison s large college-age population will play a critical role in deciding the result. Some of those students attended the Friday rally.   It s just so nice to see someone who s actually joyful,  said Kaitlin Olson, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. During Biden s painful debate performance against Trump, Olson said,  it was like,  This is scary.  Now that Kamala is running, I m like,  OK, a little more joy.     I think we re gonna turn out higher than expected,  said Jake Leismer, a college freshman who took the bus from campus, joining up with Olson and a group of students at the rally.  The Democratic-coordinated campaign, which supports Democrats up and down the ballot, has hired seven full-time campus organizers across the state and a youth organizing coordinator, according to a source familiar with the Harris campaign s staffing operations in Wisconsin. Kelly Conner, a campus organizer based in Madison, said the campaign has been met with enthusiasm – even hosting a bonfire to ceremonially burn copies of Wisconsin s gerrymandered electoral maps, which the state abandoned this year after years of progressive and Democratic party organizing.   We have lots of volunteers that have never volunteered before that want to get out and knock doors,  said Conner.  The young-people effect in Wisconsin came to light fully in 2023, when college students turned out in droves to elect Janet Protasiewicz to the Wisconsin supreme court, creating a liberal majority on the bench. At the heart of the race was abortion access, which has been caught in a legal snarl since the fall of Roe v Wade triggered a 175-year-old ban in the state.   They know the stakes,  said Conner.  This election is about fascism versus democracy, and students are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump never sets foot in the White House again. "
5,51,"ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos",Are Republicans still talking about abortion?,,https://abcnews.go.com/538/republicans-talking-abortion/story?id=113884930,"For decades, Republicans had a unified message on abortion: The party was  pro-life,  and they leaned into the issue of abortion to turn out their base, who largely agreed. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the message that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. Sure enough, Trump s conservative appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court helped deliver on that promise in the landmark 2022 decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization.  That decision, though, also upended abortion politics in America in a way that turned the tables on Republicans. Since then, expanding and protecting abortion rights has largely been a winning issue for Democrats at the ballot box, while Republicans have struggled to find a cohesive message. This year, the party has been somewhat split as it balances continued calls from conservatives to press for some form of national abortion ban with the reality that abortion restrictions are becoming increasingly unpopular in the post-Dobbs landscape. Despite appointing the justices who overturned Roe and previously saying he d support a national abortion ban, Trump has waffled on the issue heading into the general election, and the party appears to be following his lead, at least when it comes to its official party line: For the first time in four decades, the Republican National Committee left language supporting a national ban on abortion out of its platform this cycle.  We saw this split play out in this cycle s Republican primaries as well. While candidates  exact stances on abortion are sometimes hard to pinpoint, we read the campaign websites of every candidate who ran in the 2024 Republican primaries for U.S. House, U.S. Senate or governor to see what they said, or didn t say, about abortion, and whether they won their contests. Out of around 1100 total GOP primary candidates, we found 377 whose home page, biography or issue page(s) used at least one of the following phrases:  pro-life,   sanctity of life,   right to life,   no abortion,   against abortion  or  unborn,  and did not say abortion is an issue of states  rights (as of the date of their respective primary contests). Meanwhile, far more Republicans running in these primaries, 501, didn t mention the issue of abortion at all.  As for which candidates ran on an anti-abortion platform, a closer look at the types of races they ran in and won can tell us more about the party s evolving stance on the issue:  Overall, nearly three-quarters (152 of 209) of the races we tracked in seats rated solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report included at least one candidate with an explicitly anti-abortion platform, and 134 were won by one of those candidates. That means nearly two-thirds of races in solid red districts will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this November who s almost certain to win election.  Anti-abortion candidates also ran in, and often won, Republican primaries in the handful of competitive races that are rated as likely or lean Republican, though they were less dominant here. Just over half of these races (11 of 19) had at least one candidate with an anti-abortion platform, while fewer than half (eight of 19) will have an anti-abortion nominee on the general election ballot.  Meanwhile, many Republican candidates in swing states and in House districts ranked as toss-ups chose to downplay abortion as an issue. Our analysis found explicitly anti-abortion candidates in 11 of the 28 districts ranked as toss-ups, but only five anti-abortion primary winners: Bernie Moreno in Ohio s Senate race, Laurie Buckhout in North Carolina s 1st District, Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania s 7th, Don Bacon in Nebraska s 2nd and Juan Ciscomani in Arizona s 6th. Most of the winners in these races, 16 of 28, actually avoided mentioning abortion on their campaign websites completely. Some of these candidates, however, like Alaska U.S. House candidate Nick Begich, have made support for policies like a national abortion ban clear in other venues — another strategy for trying to de-emphasize the issue in their official messaging while still staking out a conservative stance.  And finally, Republicans running in Democratic territory were much less likely to run on anti-abortion platforms: Half of the 36 GOP primaries in races that lean or are likely Democratic featured anti-abortion nominees, but only four of those races (11 percent) will see an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this fall. The numbers are similar in solidly Democratic races, in which 15 percent will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee. As in toss-up districts, more than half of Republican nominees in these races didn t mention abortion on their websites during their primary campaigns.  ***  All of this reflects a careful balance that Republican politicians these days have to strike between appealing to their party base in primaries and pressures to moderate when facing competitive general elections.  Public opinion is much closer to the Democratic Party s stance on the issue, as abortion restrictions remain unpopular even in red states. Polling from the Public Religion Research Institute last year found only five states — Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah — where the majority of voters did not support abortion being legal in all or most cases. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in most cases, while 34 percent said abortion should be illegal in most cases.  But while public opinion has moved left on the issue over time, Republican opinion has remained relatively stagnant, widening the gap between the Republican and general electorate. This is especially true of white evangelical Christians, an important part of the Republican base in the Trump era. Seventy-three percent of this group supports banning abortion in all or most cases, according to a Pew Research Center poll earlier this year — far more than other religious groups (33 percent of other protestants) and Republican or Republican-leaning voters as a whole (57 percent).  Plus, primary contests specifically tend to attract the most committed partisans, giving GOP politicians ample reason to  run to the right  to win their party s nominations — even if those same candidates may de-emphasize abortion as an issue in their general election bids.  The people who turn out in the primaries are the ones who have the strongest belief, and for Republicans, that often means the people who are the most strongly anti-abortion,  said Anne Whitesell, a political scientist at Miami University in Ohio who studies politics and gender, and has researched anti-abortion activists post-Dobbs.  For example, all three non-incumbent candidates who won GOP nominations in toss-up races and included anti-abortion language on their websites (Moreno, Buckhout and Mackenzie) ran in primaries against at least one other anti-abortion candidate. And two of them, Buckhout and Mackenzie, have since removed anti-abortion language from their campaign websites as they prepare for tight general election contests against Democratic incumbents.  In recent election cycles, Democrats nationwide have relied on abortion to turn out their base while also winning independents, tying Republicans to unpopular abortion stances. Abortion has also become much more salient with voters, especially for those that lean toward Democrats or identify as pro-choice. Thirty-two percent of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shared their views on the issue in a Gallup poll from May, up from 24 percent in 2020 — a difference that was largely driven by pro-choice voters, 40 percent of whom said that was true. Plus, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling connected to its anti-abortion law that threatened access to in vitro fertilization treatments has further complicated the picture, opening a new line of attack for Democrats when it comes to reproductive rights.  But Republicans, especially Trump, have also tried to flip the script on abortion and paint Democrats as extremists by making false claims about late-term abortions and claiming that Democratic policies would allow for killing babies after birth. Others, like Trump s presidential primary opponent Nikki Haley, have urged a less combative approach and acknowledged  diverse opinions  within the party. It makes sense, given that many Republican women in particular support protecting access to abortion in some circumstances, according to polling from KFF. Still, the anti-abortion forces within the party aren t going anywhere soon, and more moderate Republicans aren t necessarily going to ditch their party over the issue.  On the whole, are they going to vote for a Democrat instead of the Republican? Probably not,  Whitesell said.  Still, voters trust Democrats and Harris more on abortion by a wide margin, and women voters continue to say it s an important issue for them. Abortion could help tip the balance in some of November s key races, and we ll be watching to see how anti-abortion Republicans pivot from their primary messages, or whether an updated message could help the party make gains on what seems to be a losing issue for them.
