1,1,,"Euphoric two years ago, US anti-abortion movement is now divided and worried as election nears",,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/euphoric-two-years-ago-us-anti-abortion-movement-is-now-divided-and-worried-as-election-nears/ar-AA1qXfUl?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Just two years ago, leading anti-abortion activists were euphoric as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, thus ending the nationwide right to abortion.  Now, with a presidential election fast approaching, their movement is disunited and worried. Within their own ranks, there is second-guessing and finger-pointing, plus trepidation that Election Day might provide new proof that their cause is broadly unpopular.  Michael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at The Catholic University of America, offered an overview of how the movement had fared since the Roe ruling in June 2022.   Things have not necessarily unfolded as we would hope,  he wrote in an email to The Associated Press.  There is certainly a sense among pro-life leaders that we should have had a stronger post-Roe game plan in place.    I always remind fellow pro-lifers that we were never promised a smooth glide path to victory,  he added.  There will certainly be setbacks and disappointments along the way.   A key reason for the wariness is the anti-abortion movement s recent losing streak on abortion-related ballot measures in seven states, including conservative Kansas and Kentucky. Nine more states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights in the Nov. 5 election — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. In several of them, abortion opponents tried various unsuccessful strategies for blocking the measures.   Pro-life people don t wear rose-colored glasses; we know we have a huge task ahead of us,  Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told the AP.  Because of the massive amounts of money being dumped into the ballot measures from those allied with the abortion industry and the Democratic Party, it s an uphill battle.    We will continue to educate, to make people aware of the catastrophic result if these measures pass,  she added.  I have not seen flagging energy or any loss of determination among pro-life people.   Texas is among the Republican-governed states that have enacted near-total abortion bans. Yet nationally, Texas Right to Life president John Seago said, the anti-abortion movement  is in a critical chapter right now.    Following a historic legal victory, we have realized that while we had enjoyed massive legislative and legal victories in the last decade, public opinion had not followed the same trajectory,  he added.  Troy Newman, who heads the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, recently published an online opinion piece assailing the movement he s been a part of for 25 years.   The tide has turned, and the pro-life message is now considered a political liability that could prevent President Trump s victorious return to the White House,  Newman wrote.   After evaluating the terrible mistakes of the pro-life movement over the last several years, I can only conclude that it is our fault,  Newman wrote.  We have had over 50 years to change the culture s position on abortion only to have failed miserably.   In an interview with the AP, Newman blamed those in his own ranks for the predicament — saying some anti-abortion leaders should have been more adamant in their positions.  We lose the minute we stop focusing on the babies,  he said.  Kristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life of America, suggested via email that Newman s views were ill-suited to the post-Roe era. She said the students in her organization were embracing the challenges of a state-by-state playing field.  But she acknowledged the magnitude of the challenges.   I actually believe the biggest threat is ourselves — our mindsets — which will lead to decreased recruitment, training, and mobilization of our grassroots army of love,  she wrote recently in the conservative outlet Townhall.   Look at the struggles we face this fall with several late-term abortion ballot referendums,  she added.  Most will likely be a political loss for our movement because, in most states, a politically sophisticated, organized, and well-funded state-wide movement is not present.   Hawkins also acknowledged the anger among some anti-abortion activists over the inconsistent rhetoric on abortion coming from the Republican presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.   I m not here to make apologies for the Campaign and their political miscalculations, which are dividing us and could very well lead to their defeat,  wrote Hawkins.  Trump nominated the Supreme Court members who were crucial to overturning Roe and called it  a beautiful thing to watch  as various states took different directions. He has been evasive on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if Congress approved one; his  leave it to the states  approach conveys acceptance of the current patchwork map in which abortion is widely available in at least half the states.  Eligible to vote in Florida, Trump has criticized as too restrictive a new state law banning abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy. But he said he would vote against the ballot measure that would make abortion legal until fetal viability.  Trump s support for a state-by-state solution was a factor in the decision of Charles Camosy, an anti-abortion Catholic academic, to declare he now feels politically estranged.   The Republican Party has rejected our point of view. Democrats are running a candidate ( Kamala Harris ) who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign,  Camosy, a medical humanities professor at Creighton University School of Medicine, wrote recently in The Atlantic.   Pro-lifers — those who believe that protecting vulnerable and unborn life should be a primary policy priority — now do not fit in either major political party.   In an interview, Camosy said abortion-rights supporters were better prepared for the post-Roe era than their adversaries   They were well-funded, they developed key relationships with the media,  Camosy said, while some Republican-controlled legislatures – in his view -- went too far with stringent abortion bans.   I see this moment as an opportunity,  Camosy wrote in The Atlantic.  Pro-life 3.0 must welcome people from multiple political and policy perspectives, working for both prenatal justice and social support for women and families.   Some other anti-abortion activists have forcefully renounced Trump, including leaders of End Abortion Ohio.   We call on God-fearing American voters to withhold their votes from Trump until he evidences genuine repentance for his pro-abortion stance,  said the group s executive director, Nicholas Kallis.  However, Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis is encouraging support for Trump.   A vast majority of our statewide membership absolutely support President Trump and believe he would advance the protection of life at the federal level ... more than a Kamala administration would,  he said.  It is not even close.   Other anti-abortion leaders have made similar calculations.  One example: Back in April, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said she was  deeply disappointed  in Trump s willingness to leave abortion policy to the states.  These days, in a move potentially benefiting Trump, the group plans a $92 million voter outreach program in battleground states depicting Harris and other Democratic candidates as  extremists  on abortion.   It is imperative that the pro-life movement fully unify and mobilize to defeat this threat,  Dannenfelser said.  Among those embracing Trump is Frank Pavone, who continues to lead Priests for Life despite being defrocked in 2022 after feuding with his bishop over his anti-abortion and partisan political activities.   Trump has brought in far more people than he has alienated,  Pavone said via email.  His statements have blunted the effectiveness of the dire, scare-mongering Democrat warnings that the Republicans will ban all abortions.   ___"
1,2,,Two Deaths Linked to Abortion Pills Despite Experts Saying They Are Safe,,https://www.newsweek.com/harris-speech-georgia-after-abortion-deaths-safe-ruling-1956828,"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to address abortion rights in Georgia, a state now grappling with the tragic deaths of two women linked to complications from abortion pills despite experts declaring the pills are  safe.   Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for medical treatment following the use of abortion pills, marking the first publicly reported case of a woman dying due to delayed care associated with state abortion restrictions. Similarly, Candi Miller, who suffered from lupus, diabetes, and hypertension, also died after taking pills ordered online.  An autopsy revealed fetal tissue that had not been expelled; however, the state s maternal mortality review committee did not attribute her death to the medication.  Experts emphasize that the abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, remain safe and effective options for terminating early pregnancies. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, demonstrating a high success rate of 97.4% for completing an abortion. While there are rare instances of excessive bleeding that may require emergency care, the FDA has repeatedly reaffirmed the drug s safety profile.  Over the years, the agency has eased many restrictions on mifepristone, culminating in a 2021 decision that allowed the medication to be mailed directly to patients.  The deaths of Thurman and Miller come at a time when abortion access is a contentious issue across the country. Critics of the current regulations argue that the FDA s easing of restrictions has contributed to an increase in emergency complications. However, medical professionals counter that only a tiny fraction of patients—less than 0.32%—experience major adverse effects.  Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, notes that many ER visits following medication abortions do not necessarily indicate serious complications. Instead, patients often seek reassurance or answers to their questions rather than requiring immediate medical intervention.  Harris s upcoming address underscores the urgent need for informed discussions about reproductive health in a state struggling with strict abortion laws and the tragic consequences they can produce. Advocates for mifepristone highlight that its safety profile is comparable to many common medications, such as ibuprofen while arguing safety is critical to ensure continued access to these health resources.  The situation in Georgia not only highlights individual tragedies but also illustrates the broader national discourse on abortion access and the implications of restrictive laws on women s health outcomes.  As Harris prepares to speak, the stakes are high for women across the country.  This article includes reporting from The Associated Press"
1,3,,A dramatic rise in pregnant women dying in Texas after abortion ban,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/pregnancy-deaths-rose-by-56-in-texas-after-2021-abortion-ban-exclusive-analysis-shows/ar-AA1qVFAy?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"The number of women in Texas who died while pregnant, during labor or soon after childbirth skyrocketed following the state s 2021 ban on abortion care — far outpacing a slower rise in maternal mortality across the nation, a new investigation of federal public health data finds.  From 2019 to 2022, the rate of maternal mortality cases in Texas rose by 56%, compared with just 11% nationwide during the same time period, according to an analysis by the Gender Equity Policy Institute. The nonprofit research group scoured publicly available reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shared the analysis exclusively with NBC News.   There s only one explanation for this staggering difference in maternal mortality,  said Nancy L. Cohen, president of the GEPI.  All the research points to Texas  abortion ban as the primary driver of this alarming increase.    Texas, I fear, is a harbinger of what s to come in other states,  she said.  The SB 8 effect  The Texas Legislature banned abortion care as early as five weeks into pregnancy in September 2021, nearly a year before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the case that protected a federal right to abortion — in June 2022.  At the time, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, lauded the bill as a measure that  ensures the life of every unborn child.   Texas law now prohibits all abortion except to save the life of the mother.  The passage of Texas  Senate Bill 8 gave GEPI researchers the opportunity to take an early look at how near-total bans on abortion — including cases in which the mother s life was in danger — affected the health and safety of pregnant women.  The SB 8 effect, Cohen s team found, was swift and stark. Within a year, maternal mortality rose in all racial groups studied.  Among Hispanic women, the rate of women dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after increased from 14.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 to 18.9 in 2022. Rates among white women nearly doubled — from 20 per 100,000 to 39.1. And Black women, who historically have higher chances of dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after, saw their rates go from 31.6 to 43.6 per 100,000 live births.  While maternal mortality spiked overall during the pandemic, women dying while pregnant or during childbirth rose consistently in Texas following the state s ban on abortion, according to the Gender Equity Policy Institute.   If you deny women abortions, more women are going to be pregnant, and more women are going to be forced to carry a pregnancy to term,  Cohen said.  Beyond the immediate dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, there is growing evidence that women living in states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas, are far more likely to go without prenatal care and much less likely to find an appointment with an OB-GYN.  Doctors say the feeling among would-be moms is fear.   Fear is something I d never seen in practice prior to Senate Bill 8,  said Dr. Leah Tatum, an OB-GYN in private practice in Austin, Texas. Tatum, who was not involved with the GEPI study, said that requests for sterilization procedures among her patients doubled after the state s abortion ban.  That is, women prefer to lose their ability to ever have children over the chance that they might become pregnant following SB 8.   Patients feel like they re backed into a corner,  Tatum said.  If they already knew that they didn t want to pursue pregnancy, now they re terrified.   Tatum said she s seeing many women in their late 30s and 40s who, even though they d like to have a child, worry they wouldn t have an option to end the pregnancy if it turned out that the baby wouldn t be born healthy.   What happens if I end up with a genetically abnormal fetus?   Tatum said her patients have asked her. They worry their options are limited, she said.   Treated like a criminal   That unthinkable tragedy happened to Kaitlyn Kash, 37, of Austin, Texas.  Kash had a textbook pregnancy with her first child, a healthy little boy, born in 2018.   It d been so easy the first time,  she said.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think we would go down the journey that we went down.   When she became pregnant again, it wasn t until Kash s second trimester, at 13 weeks, that she and her husband, Cory, discovered that their fetus had severe skeletal dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder affecting bone and cartilage growth. It was highly unlikely the baby would survive.   We were told that his bones would break in utero and he would suffocate at birth,  Kash said.  We were expecting our doctor to tell us how we were going to care for our baby, how we were going to end his pain.   It was October 2021, just a month after Texas passed the SB 8 abortion law.   We were told that we should get a second opinion, but make sure that it was outside of Texas,  she said.  At 15 weeks, Kash had to travel to Kansas to terminate her doomed pregnancy. Outside the medical clinic, protesters harassed the grief-stricken mom.   I was being treated like a criminal,  she said.  I didn t get the dignity that I deserved to say goodbye to my child.    It s just another example of how it s heartbreaking to practice in the state of Texas,  Tatum said.  These patients are asking for help. The state of Texas has failed women. "
1,4,,Trump Claims Women ‘Will No Longer Be Thinking About Abortion’ If He Wins,,https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-claims-women-will-no-longer-be-thinking-about-abortion-if-he-wins-efcf6c7c,"The comments underscored Trump s anxiety over the issue, which has proven to be a powerful motivator for women and could play a major role in the suburban areas that may decide the election. The Harris campaign quickly circulated his remarks, with a spokeswoman saying:  After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he s trying to tell us how to think.   Harris, who has campaigned aggressively on abortion rights, traveled to Georgia Friday where she assailed Trump for appointing three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and blamed Trump for states  restrictive abortion laws.  This is a healthcare crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis,  she said.  She also referenced reporting by ProPublica on two women who died in Georgia, arguing that it was due to abortion laws in the state.  He is proud,  Harris said.  Proud that women are dying?…How dare he?   A Wall Street Journal poll taken in late August found Harris leading Trump in a head-to-head matchup among women voters by 13 percentage points, while Trump led among men by 10 percentage points. Asked whether there was an issue they felt so strongly about that they wouldn t vote for a candidate they disagreed with on it, 33% of women in the poll identified abortion—far higher than any other issue.  The Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe has unfurled a messy patchwork of state laws across the country. When Roe was overturned, about half of the states sought to ban or heavily restrict abortion. Today, that number stands at around 18, in part because abortion-rights groups have won seven straight ballot referendums.  While Trump has continued to brag about overturning Roe, he has wavered on abortion, as the issue has proved motivating for Democrats in midterm and off-year elections.  Trump, a Florida resident, said earlier this month that the state s current ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy was too short, and suggested he would vote for a ballot initiative that would allow abortion until fetal viability, or about halfway through a typical pregnancy. His campaign walked back the comments, and Trump a day later said he would vote no.  In citing opposition to the Florida measure, Trump said Democrats were  radical  and wanted to legalize the procedure until the ninth month of a pregnancy. He falsely claimed some states allow a mother to  execute the baby after birth.  Infanticide is illegal in every state. Major medical associations say abortions can only be performed during a pregnancy, not after it has ended.  Harris said she supports legislation that would restore the protections in Roe v. Wade, which would make abortion widely legal until fetal viability, or until roughly 23 weeks of pregnancy. Roe provided exceptions after that if a woman s life or health was in danger.  Harris has repeatedly said that Trump would sign a national abortion ban. Trump has said he won t do that, but in his lone debate with Harris he declined to commit to vetoing such legislation if it were to come across his desk."
2,5,,Democrats Are the Real Abortion Radicals | Opinion,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-are-the-real-abortion-radicals-opinion/ar-AA1qQqP7?ocid=BingNewsVerp," The majority of Americans believe in a woman s right to make decisions about her own body,  Vice President Kamala Harris stated emphatically on the debate stage in Philadelphia.  Harris was not lying when she made that point, but what she was concealing—and what many in the media have been concealing, too—is the consensus that s grown within the American public about not just a woman s right to an abortion, but about limits on how long that right should extend into a pregnancy.  A look back at Gallup s polling in 2022 on the issue reveals that a record-high 69 percent of Americans support the right, and there were endless headlines reporting that news. But there was no media fanfare about Gallup s polling on limits to a woman s right to an abortion, and we know the reason why: the outcome was inconvenient. It turns out that after 14 weeks of pregnancy, Americans  support for abortion plunged in the Gallup polling. By 24 weeks—six months into a pregnancy term—the bottom fell out, with nearly two-thirds of Americans against. Two-thirds.  Gallup reported in its 2022 summary that Americans are twice as likely to say abortions at 24 weeks should be illegal—a true American consensus that Harris, the Democratic Party, and most of the mainstream media ignored.  Dig a bit deeper, and the abortion polling gets even more interesting. Gallup data made clear that there are more extremists on the pro-choice side of the aisle: a stunning 19 percent believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while a mere 8 percent believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. And surprise, surprise, that cold hard fact got no media play either.  And so the question remains: why is so much of the media covering for the extreme abortion positions of Harris and most of the Democratic Party—while having no problem reporting the supposedly more extreme position of their political rivals?  It is not just the polling consensus on abortion from the American people that has gone underreported; it s Harris  real-life abortion voting record as a U.S. senator from California—and that of the Democratic Party as a whole.  Let s review that voting history—and by all means, click the embedded links to see the congressional voting rolls for yourself.  During her time as U.S. senator, as former U.S. consul to Bermuda Lee Rizzuto explained in a Daily Caller column, Harris voted not once but twice against S.311 (the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act). The bill would have prohibited health care practitioners, to quote the legislative language,  from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.  In 2019, 53 senators voted for the bill, including three Democrats (Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia), and 44 voted against—none of the Republicans—leaving the bill short of the 60 Senate votes needed to make it law.  Harris also voted in February of 2020 against S. 3275 (the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act) which would have banned late-term abortions after five months of pregnancy—the point at which unborn children can feel pain. The vote tally was again 53 yeas (including only two Democrats) and 44 nays.  In addition, Harris  party nearly unanimously backed the radical Women s Health Protection Act, a bill that reads like a manifesto for unlimited and unrestricted abortion rights through all nine months of the pregnancy.  The bill, which both House and Senate Democrats have tried to pass, permits late-term abortion procedures on nearly fully formed children.  This inhumane bill has become the Democrat Party s standard,  Rizzuto writes.  It garnered a whopping 99% support from House Democrats in both 2021 and 2022, passing the House by 218-211 and 219-210 respectively, with only one Democrat voting against it both years.   But things get even worse when you see how the Democrats, their allies, and the media spin these matters. Consider the Guttmacher Institute, a leading voice on the abortion activist front. A look at their national map of state abortion policies reveals just how out of step they are with the American public when it comes to abortion limits.  The map is color coded, with each color representing differing categories, from most restrictive to most protective. What s most interesting is what the institution considers  restrictive.  Click on the  restrictive  state of Pennsylvania, and you ll discover that abortion is legally permissible up to 24 weeks (the sixth month of pregnancy), a limit the vast majority of Americans would not describe as  restrictive.  Click the  restrictive  state of Wisconsin, and you ll find that abortion in the state is legal up to 22 weeks. Kansas, another  restrictive  state, is 22 weeks, too. Click Virginia—another  restrictive  state—and you ll discover abortions are legal until the end of the second trimester. Wyoming, another  restrictive  state, is 24 to 26 weeks. That s up to two weeks into the sixth month of pregnancy.  Maybe abortion activists should have a conversation with the voters in those so-called  restrictive  states—and the vast majority of Americans who agree with them when it comes to limits to abortion rights—and recalibrate their definitions.  It s also time for the GOP to have a conversation with the American people about abortion extremism in the Democratic Party, and how Kamala Harris, nonprofit activist groups, and their allies in the mainstream media are out of step with the vast majority of Americans when it comes to limits on abortion.  Rizzuto is one of the few GOP leaders to take a public and pragmatic stand on abortion, pointing a way forward for the party to best communicate the extreme nature of its opponents.  Abortion laws should be left up to each individual state. Late-term abortions should not be permitted,  Rizzuto explains.  If the American public understood that these two sentences encapsulate the policies of the GOP and how horrific the policies of the Democrats are, they would support the GOP on this issue.   Voters will decide in November where they stand on this issue. Without strong GOP messaging on the extreme positions of the Democratic Party as it relates to abortion limits—and just how far from mainstream American opinion Harris and the Democratic Party actually are—it may just cost the GOP the election.

2,6,,"Trump makes play for women's vote, vows to ensure 'powerful exceptions' for abortion",,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-makes-play-for-womens-vote-vows-to-ensure-powerful-exceptions-for-abortion/ar-AA1qXGEn?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Former President Trump vowed to  protect women at a level never seen before  if elected, and to ensure that  powerful exceptions  for abortion are adopted across the nation, in a social media post early Saturday.  Trump, in the lengthy late-night missive to his Truth Social in all capitalized letters, said  women are poorer than they were four years ago, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are more depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago.   TRUMP VOWS HE  WILL NOT BLOCK  ABORTION PILLS OR MEDICATION IF ELECTED, SAYS HE BELIEVES IN  EXCEPTIONS    I will fix all of that, and fast, and at long last this national nightmare will be over,  he said.  Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free!   Polls have consistently shown Trump running strongly, against Vice President Kamala Harris in most demographic groups, but struggling with women. Much of that has been attributed to the fact that the three justices he picked for the Supreme Court helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had enshrined abortion protections under federal law.  In his post, Trump wrote that women  will no longer be thinking about abortion, because it is now where it always had to be, with the states, and a vote of the people—and with powerful exceptions, like those that Ronald Reagan insisted on for rape, incest, and the life of the mother—but not allowing for Democrat demanded late term abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, or even execution of a baby after birth.   READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP   I will protect women at a level never seen before,  he said.  They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure.   Trump added:  Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and great again!   The former president s play for the female vote comes after Vice President Harris campaigned in Georgia, delivering a speech about the consequences of, what her campaign calls  extreme Trump Abortion Bans.    After Vice President Harris spent the week speaking about the consequences of Trump Abortion Bans and the stakes of this election for women s lives, Donald Trump snapped — taking to his phone late at night to rant and rave about women,  Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in response to Trump s Truth Social post.  After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he s trying to tell us how to think.   Chitika said  Trump thinks he can control women — he s wrong.   The Harris campaign said he is  terrified that women across the country will vote like our lives and freedoms depend on it, because they do.    Women aren t stupid. We see Trump s Project 2025 agenda for what it is: an extreme plan to ban abortion nationwide and threaten access to IVF and birth control,  Chitika said.  We ll vote like it this November.   JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK  But Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital that Harris and President Joe Biden have put women s lives in danger, and noted the names of women who have been killed by illegal immigrants.   President Trump is right. Kamala may want to be the first woman president, but she s made the lives of women worse — more dangerous and more unaffordable,  Leavitt said.  If Kamala cared about protecting women, she would close the border and stop allowing rapists and murderers to flow into our country to prey on young women and girls. Kamala has never said the names of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nunguaray, and Rachel Morin. President Trump has honored their lives and consoled their grieving families.   Leavitt added:  If women want safety, security and prosperity for our families, there s only one option on the ballot — President Trump.   As for Project 2025, a blueprint for a Republican administration crafted by the Heritage Foundation, Leavitt repeated Trump s assertion that he did not commission it and has no plans to implement it if elected.   President Trump has repeatedly said he has nothing to do with Project 2025,  Leavitt said, adding that  Kamala s campaign is lying because they are losing.   Harris continues to claim that Trump will install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions, despite Trump repeatedly saying that he would never support a national abortion ban, and believes in exceptions for abortion, including rape, incest, and life of the mother.  Harris has refused to say whether she supports any abortion restrictions up to birth.  Trump has vowed that he  will not block  abortion pills or abortion medication for women, should he be elected president."
2,7,,Are Republicans still talking about abortion?,,https://abcnews.go.com/538/republicans-talking-abortion/story?id=113884930,"For decades, Republicans had a unified message on abortion: The party was  pro-life,  and they leaned into the issue of abortion to turn out their base, who largely agreed. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the message that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. Sure enough, Trump s conservative appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court helped deliver on that promise in the landmark 2022 decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization.  That decision, though, also upended abortion politics in America in a way that turned the tables on Republicans. Since then, expanding and protecting abortion rights has largely been a winning issue for Democrats at the ballot box, while Republicans have struggled to find a cohesive message. This year, the party has been somewhat split as it balances continued calls from conservatives to press for some form of national abortion ban with the reality that abortion restrictions are becoming increasingly unpopular in the post-Dobbs landscape. Despite appointing the justices who overturned Roe and previously saying he d support a national abortion ban, Trump has waffled on the issue heading into the general election, and the party appears to be following his lead, at least when it comes to its official party line: For the first time in four decades, the Republican National Committee left language supporting a national ban on abortion out of its platform this cycle.  We saw this split play out in this cycle s Republican primaries as well. While candidates  exact stances on abortion are sometimes hard to pinpoint, we read the campaign websites of every candidate who ran in the 2024 Republican primaries for U.S. House, U.S. Senate or governor to see what they said, or didn t say, about abortion, and whether they won their contests. Out of around 1100 total GOP primary candidates, we found 377 whose home page, biography or issue page(s) used at least one of the following phrases:  pro-life,   sanctity of life,   right to life,   no abortion,   against abortion  or  unborn,  and did not say abortion is an issue of states  rights (as of the date of their respective primary contests). Meanwhile, far more Republicans running in these primaries, 501, didn t mention the issue of abortion at all.  As for which candidates ran on an anti-abortion platform, a closer look at the types of races they ran in and won can tell us more about the party s evolving stance on the issue:  Overall, nearly three-quarters (152 of 209) of the races we tracked in seats rated solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report included at least one candidate with an explicitly anti-abortion platform, and 134 were won by one of those candidates. That means nearly two-thirds of races in solid red districts will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this November who s almost certain to win election.  Anti-abortion candidates also ran in, and often won, Republican primaries in the handful of competitive races that are rated as likely or lean Republican, though they were less dominant here. Just over half of these races (11 of 19) had at least one candidate with an anti-abortion platform, while fewer than half (eight of 19) will have an anti-abortion nominee on the general election ballot.  Meanwhile, many Republican candidates in swing states and in House districts ranked as toss-ups chose to downplay abortion as an issue. Our analysis found explicitly anti-abortion candidates in 11 of the 28 districts ranked as toss-ups, but only five anti-abortion primary winners: Bernie Moreno in Ohio s Senate race, Laurie Buckhout in North Carolina s 1st District, Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania s 7th, Don Bacon in Nebraska s 2nd and Juan Ciscomani in Arizona s 6th. Most of the winners in these races, 16 of 28, actually avoided mentioning abortion on their campaign websites completely. Some of these candidates, however, like Alaska U.S. House candidate Nick Begich, have made support for policies like a national abortion ban clear in other venues — another strategy for trying to de-emphasize the issue in their official messaging while still staking out a conservative stance.  And finally, Republicans running in Democratic territory were much less likely to run on anti-abortion platforms: Half of the 36 GOP primaries in races that lean or are likely Democratic featured anti-abortion nominees, but only four of those races (11 percent) will see an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this fall. The numbers are similar in solidly Democratic races, in which 15 percent will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee. As in toss-up districts, more than half of Republican nominees in these races didn t mention abortion on their websites during their primary campaigns.  ***  All of this reflects a careful balance that Republican politicians these days have to strike between appealing to their party base in primaries and pressures to moderate when facing competitive general elections.  Public opinion is much closer to the Democratic Party s stance on the issue, as abortion restrictions remain unpopular even in red states. Polling from the Public Religion Research Institute last year found only five states — Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah — where the majority of voters did not support abortion being legal in all or most cases. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in most cases, while 34 percent said abortion should be illegal in most cases.  But while public opinion has moved left on the issue over time, Republican opinion has remained relatively stagnant, widening the gap between the Republican and general electorate. This is especially true of white evangelical Christians, an important part of the Republican base in the Trump era. Seventy-three percent of this group supports banning abortion in all or most cases, according to a Pew Research Center poll earlier this year — far more than other religious groups (33 percent of other protestants) and Republican or Republican-leaning voters as a whole (57 percent).  Plus, primary contests specifically tend to attract the most committed partisans, giving GOP politicians ample reason to  run to the right  to win their party s nominations — even if those same candidates may de-emphasize abortion as an issue in their general election bids.  The people who turn out in the primaries are the ones who have the strongest belief, and for Republicans, that often means the people who are the most strongly anti-abortion,  said Anne Whitesell, a political scientist at Miami University in Ohio who studies politics and gender, and has researched anti-abortion activists post-Dobbs.  For example, all three non-incumbent candidates who won GOP nominations in toss-up races and included anti-abortion language on their websites (Moreno, Buckhout and Mackenzie) ran in primaries against at least one other anti-abortion candidate. And two of them, Buckhout and Mackenzie, have since removed anti-abortion language from their campaign websites as they prepare for tight general election contests against Democratic incumbents.  In recent election cycles, Democrats nationwide have relied on abortion to turn out their base while also winning independents, tying Republicans to unpopular abortion stances. Abortion has also become much more salient with voters, especially for those that lean toward Democrats or identify as pro-choice. Thirty-two percent of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shared their views on the issue in a Gallup poll from May, up from 24 percent in 2020 — a difference that was largely driven by pro-choice voters, 40 percent of whom said that was true. Plus, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling connected to its anti-abortion law that threatened access to in vitro fertilization treatments has further complicated the picture, opening a new line of attack for Democrats when it comes to reproductive rights.  But Republicans, especially Trump, have also tried to flip the script on abortion and paint Democrats as extremists by making false claims about late-term abortions and claiming that Democratic policies would allow for killing babies after birth. Others, like Trump s presidential primary opponent Nikki Haley, have urged a less combative approach and acknowledged  diverse opinions  within the party. It makes sense, given that many Republican women in particular support protecting access to abortion in some circumstances, according to polling from KFF. Still, the anti-abortion forces within the party aren t going anywhere soon, and more moderate Republicans aren t necessarily going to ditch their party over the issue.  On the whole, are they going to vote for a Democrat instead of the Republican? Probably not,  Whitesell said.  Still, voters trust Democrats and Harris more on abortion by a wide margin, and women voters continue to say it s an important issue for them. Abortion could help tip the balance in some of November s key races, and we ll be watching to see how anti-abortion Republicans pivot from their primary messages, or whether an updated message could help the party make gains on what seems to be a losing issue for them.

2,9,,Abortion Ban Ruling Challenged as ND Seeks Stay Pending Appeal,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/abortion-ban-ruling-challenged-as-nd-seeks-stay-pending-appeal/ar-AA1qRmA5?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"North Dakota asked a state district judge on Wednesday to temporarily halt his recent ruling against the state s abortion ban.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court s Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization ruling in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade, which removed federal protections for abortion and left it up to the states to decide, over two dozen states created some type of abortion ban, including North Dakota.  Under North Dakota s 2023 ban, abortion is a felony except when the procedure is done to prevent a pregnant patient s death or a  serious health risk.  In cases of rape or incest, abortion is allowed up to six weeks, which is before many people know they are pregnant, according to Planned Parenthood.  The Red River Women s Clinic—an abortion clinic that used to be the only one in North Dakota before it moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, soon after Roe v. Wade was overturned—and several doctors have challenged North Dakota s abortion ban as unconstitutionally vague for physicians and its health exception as too narrow.  North Dakota asked Judge Bruce Romanick in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, to throw out the lawsuit and the plaintiffs asked him to let the trial proceed. Romanick decided to cancel the trial and later found the abortion ban unconstitutional, but has not issued a final judgment yet.  Last week, Romanick ruled that the abortion ban  is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,  and that pregnant patients in North Dakota have a fundamental right to abortion before the fetus is viable under the state constitution.   The Court is left to craft findings and conclusions on an issue of vital public importance when the longstanding precedent on that issue no longer exists federally, and much of the North Dakota precedent on that issue relied on the federal precedent now upended — with relatively no idea how the appellate court in this state will address the issue,  Romanick wrote in his ruling.  The state then asked for a stay in the case, pending an appeal of his ruling to the state Supreme Court in a filing on Wednesday.   A stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues,  state attorneys said.  Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said on Tuesday that the plaintiffs would oppose any stay in the case.   Look, they don t have to appeal, and they also don t have to seek a stay because, like I said, this decision is not leading any time soon to clinics reopening across the state,  he said.  Hearron continued:  We re talking about standard-of-care, necessary, time-sensitive health care, abortion care generally provided in hospitals or by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and for the state to seek a stay or to appeal a ruling that allows those physicians just to practice medicine I think is shameful.   Meanwhile, Republican state Senator Janne Myrdal, who introduced North Dakota s abortion ban, said she s confident the state s Supreme Court will overturn Romanick s ruling and called his decision one of the poorest legal decisions she has read.   I challenge anybody to go through his opinion and find anything but  personal opinions,   she said on Monday.  This article includes reporting from The Associated Press."
2,10,,Republicans are trying a new approach to abortion in the race for Congress,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-are-trying-a-new-approach-to-abortion-in-the-race-for-congress/ar-AA1qQYRi?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the most contested races for control of the U.S. House, many Republican candidates are speaking up about women s rights to abortion access and reproductive care in new and surprising ways, a deliberate shift for a GOP blindsided by some political ramifications of the post-Roe v. Wade era.  Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care.  In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said,  There can be no place for extremism in women s health care.   In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows,  I have always supported women s access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.   And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says,  I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.   It s a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women s lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions.  The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans  campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP s failure to grasp the political power of women s reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters.   The Republicans have always known they re actually on the wrong side of this issue,  said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party s shift  wouldn t surprise me.   With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women s access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades.  On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it s best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He s also distanced himself from the far right s longtime goal of a national abortion ban.  With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party s ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president s ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer:  We are not going back.   The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration.  Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years.  Voters didn t always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement s push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November s promised  red wave  of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority.  By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That s an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision.  In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares:  I m pro-choice.   Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars  lying about Republican candidates  positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.    Republicans can t let Democrats lie any longer — they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.   Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views — past and present.   Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,  said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats.  House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars  worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races.  Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris  example.  Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed,  We ll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.   Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions.  Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — a historic accomplishment — during the former president s term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority.  First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans.  One of the nation s leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide.  But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue.  Voters have a right to know where I stand,  Lawler said.  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report."
3,11,,Harris to speak about abortion in Georgia after deaths of two women,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/harris-to-speak-about-abortion-in-georgia-after-deaths-of-two-women/ar-AA1qTwqf?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris plans on Friday to give her first abortion speech in Atlanta, where she will address the deaths of two Georgia women who, according to a senior campaign official, highlight the  dangerous consequences  of what Harris calls  Trump Abortion Bans.   Reproductive rights have been one of the driving issues of the Harris  campaign. Her team launched a  reproductive freedom  bus tour in early September with their first stop in Palm Beach County, former President Donald Trump s backyard.  According to that same senior official, Harris plans to warn Georgians to not believe what the campaign describes as Trump s flip-flopping record regarding abortion -- noting that, if given the chance, he would ban abortion nationwide.  MORE: Project 2025 and abortion: Harris tries to pin monitoring pregnancies to Trump  Trump during this month s debate noted that he had returned the regulation of abortion care to state governments, saying it should be up to the states to decide. He would not commit during the debate to vetoing a potential federal abortion ban if it came to his desk as president. Instead, he said that situation would not arise.  Harris on Friday plans to speak about two women who died in 2022. Amber Thurman and Candi Miller s deaths were a direct result of Georgia s six-week ban, according to reporting by ProPublica. The Georgia ban went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.  MORE: Fighting for their lives: Women and the impact of abortion restrictions in post-Roe America  Thurman died two weeks after the Georgia ban was passed in 2022, after waiting 20 hours in a suburban Atlanta hospital for an incomplete abortion, according to the report. Miller died after declining to seek medical care for complications from abortion medication, the report said.  Thurman s family appeared on Oprah Winfrey s  Unite for America  live-streamed event that featured Harris on Thursday. In one of the more emotional moments of the program, her mother, Shanette Williams, tearfully proclaimed that she would not let her daughter become a  statistic.   MORE: Harris teams up with Oprah to broaden her outreach to persuadable voters   Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain,  Williams recounted through tears.  I wanted to go through in silence. But I realized that it was selfish. I want y all to know that Amber was not a statistic. She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.   Georgia is a key battleground state that Biden narrowly won in 2020, beating former Trump by about 12,000 votes. Recognizing that she could not only rely on voters in the metro-Atlanta area to keep the state blue, Harris visited rural counties in southeastern Georgia during a two-day swing that culminated in a rally in Savannah.  Currently, Harris is neck-and-neck with Trump in the polls in the state, according to 538 s average. Trump leads by a one-point margin in Georgia, with 48% compared to Harris  47%.  The vice president is scheduled to head to Madison, Wisconsin, for a rally later on Friday evening."
3,12,,State Asks Judge to Pause Ruling That Struck Down North Dakota's Abortion Ban,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/state-asks-judge-to-pause-ruling-that-struck-down-north-dakotas-abortion-ban/ar-AA1qQMjm?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The state of North Dakota is asking a judge to pause his ruling from last week that struck down the state s abortion ban until the state Supreme Court rules on a planned appeal.  The state s motion to stay a pending appeal was filed Wednesday. State District Judge Bruce Romanick ruled last week that North Dakota s abortion ban  is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,  and that pregnant women in the state have a fundamental right to abortion before viability under the state constitution.  Attorneys for the state said  a stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues.   In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to an abortion. Soon afterward, the only abortion clinic in North Dakota moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, and challenged North Dakota s since-repealed trigger ban outlawing most abortions.  In 2023, North Dakota s Republican-controlled Legislature revised the state s abortion laws amid the ongoing lawsuit. The amended ban outlawed performance of all abortions as a felony crime but for procedures to prevent a pregnant woman s death or a  serious health risk  to her, and in cases of rape or incest but only up to six weeks. The law took effect in April 2023.  The Red River Women s Clinic, joined by several doctors, then challenged that law as unconstitutionally vague for doctors and its health exception as too narrow. In court in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, the state asked the judge to throw out the lawsuit, while the plaintiffs asked him to let the August trial proceed.

3,13,,Why Kamala Harris' Promises on Abortion Matter to Black Women,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/why-kamala-harris-promises-on-abortion-matter-to-black-women/ar-AA1qQnYj?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Before rising to the top of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris championed safe, legal access to abortion. On the campaign trail she has promised that if Congress passes legislation restoring reproductive freedoms, as President she would sign it into law. Recent reports show that restrictions on abortion implemented since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade jeopardize women s lives and have led to a rise in infant deaths.  This is especially significant for African American women, who are poised to suffer the worst outcomes of six-week abortion bans in places like Georgia and Texas, since Black women account for an estimated 40% of those seeking to end pregnancies. That statistic reflects a web of interconnected factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality health care, and high maternal mortality rates. Plus, history shows that in the absence of choice and contraception, Black women have gone to painful and often harrowing lengths to be self-determining.  Prior to the passage of the 13th Amendment ending slavery, enslaved Black women were literally property and denied control over their reproductive systems. Enslaved women were often raped and forced to  breed  because their progeny amplified enslavers  wealth. Further, the children they conceived of their own volition, birthed, loved, and cared for could be sold for a profit or to repay enslavers  debts, never mind being subject to the quotidian brutality that enslavement itself entailed.  Read More: Reproductive Rights Are Taking Center Stage at the DNC  Against this backdrop, enslaved women found ways to end pregnancies, sometimes using herbs to induce menstruation, or they committed infanticide. Some hoped to spare children from the horrors of slavery. Others took a different view of the matter. For example, Letty, an enslaved woman, was indicted for crushing the skull of her newborn in Virginia in 1822. She told investigators,  If the child had been one of her own colour, she would not have done as she did.  Letty s extreme act and her sentiments gesture toward the trauma of interracial rape that marked so many enslaved women s lives, and the refusal by some women to mother infants stemming from it.  After Emancipation, Black women set about reclaiming and redefining their womanhood. The restoration of virtue and bodily sanctity were of paramount importance, and many felt that having a child out of wedlock would threaten those aims. Single mothers faced dire financial implications as well as harsh judgments by the broader society.  Even families with two parents struggled and often could not afford another mouth to feed. Most Black families relied upon the income of several working family members—mothers and fathers and daughters and sons able to secure employment did so and usually contributed to the household. But even with multiple revenue streams, poverty was grinding.  Moreover, the post-Emancipation period brought its own set of cruel ironies for Black women. While enslavement was outlawed, in a practical sense rape and sexual abuse were not, because the law failed to protect Black victims. African American women remained particularly vulnerable to sexual assault as domestics working in white people s homes and would have faced degrading stigmas from any pregnancies resulting from those assaults, in addition to the distressing circumstances.  We don t have statistics for how many Black women sought to terminate such pregnancies over a century ago. But it s clear that women used a variety of tactics to do so, demonstrating their desperation and their fury at the unfair restrictions over their lives. Some went to root doctors who prescribed herbal abortifacients, an unreliable solution since the elixirs could be toxic to women, frequently fatally so. Others went to underground abortionists who performed procedures that at the time, could be quite dangerous and deadly. Newspapers from the time were littered with accounts of women and girls who died from  criminal malpractice,  frequently a euphemism for botched medical abortions. Some women bled out quickly, while others suffered as they died from painful infections.  Read More: Rape Led to 64,000 Pregnancies in 14 U.S. States With Abortion Bans, Study Says  Given the great risks of available abortion options, some women decided to conceal their pregnancies, carry to term, and kill the infants after birth, as Henrietta Thompson did in Philadelphia in 1887. Impoverished, pregnant, and unwed, she gave birth and, according to court records and newspaper accounts, placed the infant in a cesspool. Upon discovery of her actions, she explained to police officers that she had to  go out and work for a living and could not afford to pay its board.   Other women abandoned newborns at centers colloquially referred to as  baby farms.  At best, these operated as infant care centers for working mothers. On the other end, however, some proprietors subjected the children in their care to neglect that could lead to malnutrition, illness, and even death.  Mattie Burke, a Black woman operator of a notorious baby farm in Philadelphia in 1914, was charged with causing the deaths of three infants in her care. Pictures of their emaciated corpses were shown in court. Even as the mothers were distraught, one of the women defended Burke. For some, she and similar practitioners performed what was considered a necessary evil. So, while papers decried the squalid conditions in which the infants were kept and the fact that a single tin of condensed milk was shared among the children in Burke s care for a week, new mothers continued to patronize such haunts with newborns in tow.  Read More: How American Women Could Lose the Right to Birth Control  Women pressed for legal access to safe and effective birth control and, in 1960, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first oral contraception. Five years later with Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court protected the right to use contraceptives. In 1973, the Supreme Court upheld abortion rights. The decades after the passage of Roe v. Wade were not without flaws, but access to abortion paired with the advent of widely available birth control afforded Black women and girls greater avenues to avoid conceiving before they were ready to parent and safely end unwanted pregnancies if they did. These allowed them to be the stewards of their own reproductive systems.  But with the Dobbs decision overturning Roe, and with more than a dozen states banning abortion completely or severely limiting access, those gains are vulnerable. Today, a lack of access to abortion doesn t just imperil Black women s health, it also leaves them at greater risk of criminalization—as we saw in Ohio in 2023, for example, where a Black woman named Brittany Watts who had a miscarriage was arrested on charges of having abused a corpse. (The charge against her was ultimately dismissed.)  It would be easy to leave histories like Letty s, Henrietta Thompson s and Mattie Burke s in the past, but their legacies demonstrate something essential. Denying women choice does not prevent them from terminating pregnancies. Rather it compels those with few options to take dangerous risks to exercise reproductive rights. That might seem like hyperbole, but recent research suggests that only a fraction of rape and incest victims in states with bans have access to safe, legal abortions—even when those same states claim to have exceptions for these scenarios. No women and girls should have to face such horrors in America in the 21st century.

3,14,,Hochul moves to bolster struggling abortion amendment,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/hochul-moves-to-bolster-struggling-abortion-amendment/ar-AA1qRgEk?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"ALBANY, New York — Gov. Kathy Hochul is steering more than $1 million toward a flagging effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution — a move that could shore up her party s chances in key House races.  The cash infusion is designed to bail out a struggling campaign for the amendment amid Democratic fears that a well-organized opposition has gained traction with voters.  Hochul s renewed focus is also meant to silence alarm bells from Democratic operatives that top state party leaders have not done enough to support the ballot referendum and that a strategy to leverage the amendment to boost turnout could backfire.  The money will be used for TV ads as well as direct mailers to voters. Hochul is also expected to speak more publicly about the amendment and its potential impact on protecting abortion rights in this deep blue state.   It s critical voters know that an abortion amendment is on the ballot in New York this year,  Hochul said in a statement.  New Yorkers deserve the freedom to control their own lives and healthcare decisions, including the right to abortion regardless of who s in office, and this important investment will get that message out across the state.   But the referendum s fate — and Hochul s push for it — is intertwined with swing House races.  The Democratic governor has made flipping five GOP-held House seats in the state a political priority this year following criticisms from fellow Democrats like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  Known as the equality amendment, the referendum being put to voters is meant to guarantee a broad array of rights in the state constitution, including the right to an abortion.  But critics have seized on the proposed amendment s broad language, which includes rights for LGBTQ+ people.  Opponents have warned the amendment would lead to a host of unintended consequences, such as trans people participating in women s sports or a weakening of statutory rape laws.  Supporters have contended those claims amount to fear mongering and have decried the anti-trans rhetoric. Voters statewide back the amendment, 64 percent to 23 percent, according to a Siena College poll released Thursday.  But as POLITICO first reported this month, Democratic consultants working in key House races have pointed to internal polling that found arguments against the proposal were effective with battleground seat voters — especially in the crucial New York City suburbs.  Opposition to the amendment, in turn, could hurt Democratic candidates running in down-ballot races, the consultants said.  New York is considered to have some of the strongest laws on the books protecting access to abortion.  But as the Supreme Court two years ago moved to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democratic state lawmakers approved a package of measures meant to solidify abortion rights in New York. That included the equality amendment — a proposal that includes protections for  pregnancy outcomes  as well as a ban on discrimination based on gender identity. Notably, the amendment does not include the word abortion.  The way in which state lawmakers crafted the amendment has given opponents an opening as well. Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, Hochul s 2022 gubernatorial opponent, announced Thursday that he s starting a campaign to urge voters to reject the amendment in order to  save girls  sports.   Democratic lawmakers who crafted the language were at odds over how expansive to make the proposal, a process that did not directly include Hochul. Some legislators believe it was a mistake to not center the amendment solely around abortion rights.   I thought we should have been much more direct and much clearer in the language we re using,  said Tom Abinanti, a former Democratic assemblymember.  As you can see there s some confusion over the language.   Hochul had initially cheered the amendment s wide-ranging language as a way of protecting all New Yorkers.  A constellation of left-leaning organizations and reproductive-rights groups last year formed a campaign, known as New Yorkers for Equal Rights, meant to boost the amendment. But their effort failed to raise a promised $20 million to promote the measure.  State elections filings this summer showed that the committee has less than $1 million in cash on hand.  As a result, finger-pointing has ensued at a pivotal moment in the election season.  The lack of robust fundraising hasn t gone unnoticed among New York Democrats who believe Hochul was being unfairly blamed for the bumpy campaign to get the amendment approved.   An abortion ballot initiative in New York should have been a walk in the park, but for all of the bluster of the progressive organizations associated with Prop 1, it s been a case study in how not to run a professional campaign,  said a New York Democrat who was granted anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions.  On Thursday, New Yorkers for Equal Rights cheered the help, though did not mention Hochul by name.   New Yorkers for Equal Rights is proud to be powered by a broad and growing coalition across the Empire State, and every new partner who joins the fight helps bring us one step closer to permanently protecting abortion on Election Day,  said Sasha Ahuja, the campaign s director."
3,15,,NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy questions Kamala Harris’ faith-based tweet about abortion rights,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/nfl-hall-of-fame-coach-tony-yungy-questions-kamala-harris-faith-based-tweet-about-abortion-rights/ar-AA1qRQQj?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Legendary NFL coach Tony Dungy challenged a tweet from Vice President Kamala Harris about abortion rights.  Harris has been unapologetic about her stance on abortion rights for women, and she continued with a post on X Thursday.   One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: The government, and certainly Donald Trump, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  she said.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Dungy, the first Black head coach to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the modern era and second all-time, is a man of faith and questioned Harris.   Dear VP Harris: I hear you make this statement all the time,  Dungy wrote in a quote tweet.  Exactly what  faith  are you talking about when you say you don t have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)?  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP   Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general  faith  that says we re good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What  faith  are you talking about?   HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES  NO EXCEPTION,  MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE  Harris has pledged that if Congress were to pass a bill to reinstate the protections that Roe v. Wade guaranteed, she would  proudly sign it into law  if elected president in November.  Meanwhile, Trump commended the United States Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade, which has allowed states to handle the issue.  Dungy also reposted former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson s quote tweet over a Sept. 17 Harris tweet, which said,  A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school. This is exactly what we feared when Roe vs. Wade was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans prevent doctors from providing basic medical care.    Amber Thurman s tragic death was caused by complications from legal abortion drugs and gross medical malpractice,  Watson responded.  She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia s pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate.   Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.   On Dungy s tweet, one commenter wrote,  I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.    I guess you didn t see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote  Yes  on it,  Dungy replied.  Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying,  I ll be voting no.  Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances.   President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,  Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign s press secretary, said after his NBC News interview.  Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump s abortion platform would make no exception  even for rape and incest.    A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  Harris said.   Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.   Trump said moments before Harris  statement he does believe  strongly  in exceptions for abortion.   I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,  Trump said during a debate.  I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.   Dungy is a one-time Super Bowl-champion coach, which came after his 12-4 season in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts.  Dungy began his head coaching career in Tampa Bay with the Buccaneers, going 54-42 with the franchise before moving to Indy, where he quickly became a legend with Peyton Manning as his quarterback.  Dungy went 85-27 in his 112 games leading the Colts.  Fox News  Emma Colton contributed to this report.

4,17,,Georgia’s abortion ban linked to Amber Thurman's death in ProPublica investigation: What to know,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/georgia-s-abortion-ban-linked-to-amber-thurmans-death-in-propublica-investigation-what-to-know/ar-AA1qU9Ta?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"This story was updated to add new information.  Vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta Friday to respond to the deaths of two Georgia women linked to the state s abortion ban, according to a ProPublica investigation released this week.  Amber Thurman, 28, a nursing assistant and mother of a 6-year-old son died after doctors delayed necessary care due to Georgia s six-week abortion ban, says the story reported by Kavitha Surana. Medical providers stalled to provide care to treat the effects of a medication abortion, also known as a medical abortion, the investigation says.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  After sharing Thurman s death, Surana reported a second story on another Georgia woman named Candi Miller who died as a result of not seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.   To tell their stories, ProPublica reviewed medical documents, autopsies and official state committee reports, interviewed family and loved ones, spoke with government officials and consulted medical experts, doctors from across the state and U.S. and people inside hospitals.  Here s what the ProPublica investigation found and what to know about Georgia s abortion law.  ProPublica: Amber Thurman, Candi Miller die under Georgia s abortion law  ProPublica s investigation explores the stories of two women who died after Georgia s strict abortion law went into effect in July 2022. The law bans abortions after six week of pregnancy with few exceptions.  According to ProPublica, Thurman became pregnant with twins unexpectedly in 2022 and faced roadblocks to receiving reproductive care due to the state s ban. She went to North Carolina for a medication abortion but experienced rare complications after taking the prescribed abortion pills.  Thurman became septic in the hospital due to excess tissue in her uterus that did not shed from her body, causing a serious infection. Thurman needed a dilation and curettage, or D&C, a procedure in which tissue is removed from inside the uterus. However, Georgia s ban considers a D&C a felony if performed outside of specific circumstances and could land doctors behind bars for up to 10 years.  Thurman s health deteriorated for 20 hours before doctors finally took her to surgery. By then, it was too late, ProPublica s reporting says. Her heart stopped on the table.  Thurman s death was  preventable,  according to Georgia s maternal mortality review committee, which said the hospital s delay in providing the D&C due to state law  had a large impact on her fatal outcome,  ProPublica reports.  Candi Miller was a 41-year-old Georgia woman with chronic health issues including lupus and hypertension that made carrying a pregnancy life-threatening.  Already a mother of three, Miller became pregnant in the fall of 2022. Fearing for her life, she did not want to keep the pregnancy. But she found that the exceptions to the Georgia abortion ban only applied to imminent and acute life-threatening emergencies and did not extend to chronic health conditions, even those that can become lethal in pregnancy, ProPublica reports.  Unwilling to wait until things became more dire, she opted out of going to a doctor s office for fear of legal repercussions and instead underwent abortion on her own, ordering pills online. She suffered a rare complication but was reticent to seek medical care, her family later told officials. She was found unresponsive on Nov. 12 at home.  An autopsy found fetal tissue in her uterus as a result of the incomplete abortion as well as a combination of pain pills. Her family said she had avoided seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.  The state committee also deemed her death  preventable,  reports ProPublica.  What does Georgia s abortion law say?  In Georgia, abortion is banned after six weeks with some exceptions. Georgia passed the six-week ban in November 2022, and it was upheld by the state supreme court in 2023.  The ban has some exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother up to 20 weeks. Critics say six weeks is too soon because studies have shown that women generally don t discover they are pregnant until they ve at least missed one period, around five to six weeks into gestation. Some experts and healthcare workers have criticized the law as having vague, difficult-to-interpret language and restrictive stipulations around what qualifies as an  exception.   Some of the specific language that impacted Thurman s case is explored in-depth in ProPublica s report.  Supporters commend the legislation for correcting what they saw as unconstitutional laws under Roe v. Wade. Some believe life begins at conception, meaning they feel they are protecting the life of a baby in the womb. Other supporters say that abortion was too widely and loosely used before the law went into place or that their religious beliefs compel them to support restrictions. Supporters also maintain that the exceptions outlined in the bill are ample to protect the health of mothers and babies.  The  heartbeat  law, known as the LIFE Act, has been the subject of some back-and-forth in state courts, having initially been blocked by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney who previously ruled the ban  unequivocally unconstitutional  on the grounds it was introduced in 2019 before the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  The higher court, however, determined in October of last year that the new precedent set by the reversal is now the standard by which to judge abortion-related matters in a 6-1 decision.  Responses to ProPublica s investigation  Some organizations issued statements in response to ProPublica s reporting.  Nancy Northup, President & CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights said, in part:  Amber Thurman should be alive today. Her death was preventable—her doctors knew how to perform the very basic medical procedure needed to save her life, but felt their hands were tied because of the state s abortion ban. The Georgia lawmakers who passed this ban are ultimately responsible for her death, and the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.   Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs (AAPLOG) said, in part:  Amber Thurman s tragic death, recently covered by multiple news organizations, was caused by side effects of legal abortion drugs and medical negligence, not pro-life laws. Despite taking the drugs as she was instructed and seeking timely care when she experienced complications, she still died.   What has Kamala Harris said about abortion bans?  Presidential candidate Kamala Harris responded to the ProPublica piece with a statement on social media Tuesday:   A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  she said of Thurman.  Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump s actions.   Harris will also be addressing abortion bans in a planned speech in Atlanta on Friday.  What has Donald Trump said about abortion bans?   President Trump has always supported exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which Georgia s law provides,  the Trump campaign told USA TODAY in response to the death of Thurman.  With those exceptions in place, it s unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect Amber Thurman s life.   Trump has often said he believes the issue should be left up to the states.  In late August, the former president criticized Florida s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in an interview with NBC, saying  I think the six-week is too short; it has to be more time.  A day later, however, he announced he would vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would overturn the ban, citing concerns it would result in  ninth-month  abortions."

But as Election Day approaches and both presidential candidates are pressed for details of how they ll carry out their agenda, Vance has been putting forth policy ideas for addressing some of the country s most pressing issues -- even though Trump has lacked the same clarity.  One of the most public examples of this occurred during the ABC News presidential debate when Trump did not commit to vetoing a national abortion ban after Vance had said on NBC s  Meet the Press  that he would do so. Trump told the moderators he had not discussed the topic with Vance.  MORE: Key takeaways from Harris-Trump ABC News debate   Well, I didn t discuss it with JD, in all fairness,  Trump said.  When the debate moderators asked Trump what his health care plan would look like, he said it was not fully developed yet.   I have concepts of a plan,  Trump said.  I m not president right now, but if we come up with something, I would only change [Obamacare] if we come up with something that s better and less expensive.   Asked on NBC s  Meet the Press,  if Vance could clarify the former president s plan, the Ohio senator went further on details, saying Trump would pursue a  deregulatory agenda.    We want to make sure everybody is covered, but the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a one-size-fits-all approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.   On foreign policy, Vance, in alignment with Trump, has been critical of the United States  involvement in Ukraine and the billions of dollars of aid the country provided to Ukraine s war effort against Russia.  In a recent podcast interview, Vance laid out a potential approach a Trump administration would take in handling the Ukraine-Russia war, including creating a  demilitarized zone  in the parts of Ukraine that Russia has already taken over.   So I think what this looks like is Trump sits down. He says to the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Europeans,  you guys need to figure out what does a peaceful settlement look like,   Vance said on the  Shawn Ryan Show  last week.  And what it probably looks like is something like the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine. That becomes like a demilitarized zone. It s heavily fortified so the Russians don t invade again. Ukraine remains its independent sovereignty.   MORE: Assassination attempt suspect was fixated on Ukraine, sources said. Here s what Trump has said about the war.  Vance also said the rest of Ukraine that Russia did not occupy would be a  sovereign state  and that Russia would get the  guarantee of neutrality.    Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine. It doesn t join NATO, it doesn t join some of these sorts of allied institutions, and I think that s ultimately what this looks like.   Vance s suggested plan is the most specific policy outline the Trump campaign has offered regarding how it would handle the Ukraine-Russia war.  During the ABC News debate, Trump refused to answer if he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia when pressed twice. Instead, Trump said it would be in the country s best interest for the war to end and pushed for a deal to be negotiated, without offering specifics.   I think it s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done,  Trump said.  All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.   Doug Heye, a GOP strategist, told ABC News that many could view Vance s actions as filling in the policy gaps in Trump s agenda.   Trump isn t a series of policy proposals, he s an attitude,  Heye told ABC News.  MORE: Lack of communication, drone issues plagued Secret Service at Trump Pennsylvania rally: Report  Referring to Trump saying during the ABC News debate that he had not discussed the issue of possibly vetoing a federal abortion ban with Vance, Heye said anyone close to the former president should prepare for him to possibly not have their backs.   Anybody near Trump needs to be prepared for him to throw them under the bus. That s part and parcel of who he is. And I don t necessarily even say that as a criticism. It s just, you know, sort of fact,  Heye said.  How much of this is freelancing versus planned? You know, we don t know, but that possibility is always there.   William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, told ABC News in a statement that Vance and the former president aligned in their vision for the country.   President Trump and Senator Vance are totally aligned in their America First policy vision, and JD always follows President Trump s lead on the issues,  Martin told ABC News.  ABC News reached out to the Trump campaign for comment as well, but didn t hear back by the time of publication."

During the  Unite for America  event in Michigan, Harris also reflected on the change that Winfrey said she and others had observed in the vice president once she became the Democratic Party s standard-bearer.   It seems to us that something happened to you the moment Joe Biden, President Biden, stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power,  Winfrey said.   We each have those moments in our lives where it s time to step up,  Harris responded, adding that she felt a  sense of purpose,  given the stakes of November s election.  The event sought to capitalize on the skills and star power of Winfrey, who delivered her coveted endorsement of Harris at last month s Democratic National Convention. At times, the night evoked Winfrey s long-running talk show, with Harris taking questions from the media mogul and listening to members of the invited live audience gathered in a suburb of Detroit. Celebrities, ranging from Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts to comedian Chris Rock, chimed in virtually.  The livestream was geared, in part, at mobilizing grassroots activity on Harris  behalf in the hopes of edging past former President Donald Trump in what Harris campaign chairwoman Jen O Malley Dillon told the audience remains a  margin-of-error race.   Before the event kicked off, Harris  campaign said that nearly 200,000 people had RSVP d through the official sign-up – with even more expected to join on the array of social media platforms on which it was streaming.  A discussion of reproductive rights included Hadley Duvall, an abortion rights advocate who was raped and impregnated by her stepfather when she was 12 – as well as members of the family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia mother who ProPublica reported died in 2022 from a treatable infection due to delays to her medical care stemming from the state s restrictive abortion law.  Shanette, Thurman s mother, spoke publicly about the case for the first time during Thursday s livestream, saying,  Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain.    I wanted to go through in silence, but I realized that it was selfish. I want you to know, Amber was not a statistic, she was loved by a family, a strong family,  she added.  Harris, who is set to travel to Georgia on Friday to deliver remarks on women s reproductive rights, apologized to Thurman s family.   I m just so sorry,  the vice president said.  And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary, because also you just learned about how it is that she died. … And Amber s mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind, is preventable. Preventable. That word keeps coming to her.   Harris and the livestream audience also heard from 15-year-old Natalie Griffith, a student from Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, who was shot twice during a campus attack earlier this month.  Natalie, who had a cast on her left arm, was joined by her parents, Marilda and Doug, who demanded more action.  We have a job, that job is to protect our children,  an impassioned Marilda Griffith said.  We have to stop it.   Harris, who discussed owning a gun during her recent debate with Trump, reiterated Thursday that she believes it is a  false choice  to suggest someone is either in favor of the Second Amendment or wants to take everyone s guns away.  Winfrey noted that she had not known that Harris was a gun owner – prompting an off-the-cuff quip from the vice president.   If somebody breaks in my house, they re getting shot,  Harris said.   I probably should not have said that,  she added, laughing,  but my staff will deal with that later.   Harris also faced questions about some of the difficult policy issues confronting her in this contest – ranging from inflation to dealing with illegal immigration.  Asked by an audience member about her plan to  strengthen  the border, she outlined the measures to improve border security that had been included in a bipartisan congressional bill that Trump helped to kill.  Under questioning from Winfrey, Harris said she would work to revive the legislation and sign it into law should she win the White House."

4,22,,"Harris Assails Trump Over Georgia Abortion Ban, Woman’s Death",,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/harris-assails-trump-over-georgia-abortion-ban-woman-s-death/ar-AA1qVov5?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"(Bloomberg) -- Vice President Kamala Harris spotlighted the death of a woman in Georgia who was unable to obtain access to a legal abortion, laying the blame on Donald Trump and his role in the US Supreme Court overturning protections for the procedure.   This is a health-care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect,  Harris said during a rally in the metro Atlanta area Friday, taking her pitch to protect women s reproductive rights to a swing state where Democrats are using the issue to rally suburban women and independents to the polls.   He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words — quote —  I did it, and I m proud to have done it,   Harris continued, casting Trump as  proud that women are dying, proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care, proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.   Harris referred to state restrictions on abortion rights as  Trump abortion bans  and said one in three women in America live under such laws. And she assailed the former president for saying he would vote to preserve a Florida law that limited abortion in the state to the first six weeks of a pregnancy.  The Democratic presidential nominee discussed the case of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year old mother, who died in 2022 from an infection arising from an abortion.  Thurman s case was documented in a ProPublica investigation that found that under Georgia s abortion ban, at least two women in the state died after failing to get medical care in the aftermath of the Supreme Court s ruling striking down Roe. That court decision led to states across the country imposing restrictions on abortion and making reproductive health a defining issue of the 2024 presidential race. The report cast Thurman as the first abortion-related death that officials deemed preventable.   We knew that this could happen. There is the word preventable and there is another word — predictable,  Harris said.  The vice president delivered the remarks a day after she met with the family of Thurman during a town hall with talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. At the town hall, Thurman s mother said her daughter  was not a statistic  but a real person.  Harris on Friday said she had promised Thurman s mother that  Amber is not just remembered as a statistic.   Abortion is an issue that has put Trump on the defensive. As president, he nominated three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe and has used that to solidify his standing with evangelical voters and his grip on the Republican party. But with polls showing that Americans at large support abortion rights, Trump has also sought to neutralize the issue in part by re-branding himself as a champion of reproductive rights.  That pivot has highlighted how the issue is an electoral liability for the former president and has sparked criticism from both Democrats who call him insincere and religious voters who are worried he will soften on the issue.  During their lone scheduled debate so far, Harris repeatedly pressed Trump on whether he would veto a bill imposing a national ban on abortion — a question the Republican nominee deflected by saying he  wouldn t have to,  insisting the issue is now up to the states.  Trump s messaging on abortion has been inconsistent. He s said he was open to restricting access to mifepristone, a pill used in medical abortions. Trump has also vowed to mandate that the federal government or insurance companies cover the entire costs of in vitro fertilization.  Harris has vowed to sign into law a measure that restores Roe s protections and said that if Trump was elected again  I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban.    I m trying to get another debate but we ll see,  Harris said on Friday. Trump has ruled out another debate against Harris, claiming he won their showdown even as polls show voters deemed the Democrat had the better performance.  Georgia has been a hotly contested battleground, one that Biden won in 2020 by fewer than 12,000 votes and where Trump is accused of leading a conspiracy to stay in office.  An August Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found Harris leading Trump in Georgia, 49% to 47%. Harris has ramped up her campaigning in the state, including a recent bus tour that sought to court people in rural communities and disaffected Republicans.  On Friday, the Georgia State Election Board approved a controversial new rule requiring all ballots to be hand-counted at each of the state s polling sites — a move that threatens to delay reporting of the state s election results and raises concerns about ballot security.

5,23,,"Missouri Supreme Court voted 4-3 to keep abortion amendment on ballot, opinions show",,https://news.yahoo.com/news/missouri-supreme-court-voted-4-190446827.html,"The Missouri Supreme Court only narrowly rejected arguments raised by anti-abortion activists who tried to keep a measure overturning the state s abortion ban off the November ballot.  The state Supreme Court last week issued an order keeping the proposed state constitutional amendment – called Amendment 3 – on the Nov. 5 ballot. The judges  decision came hours before a deadline to finalize the ballot and they didn t explain their reasoning at the time.  The court on Friday released a full opinion that goes deep into the its rationale, revealing a 4-3 divide over the last-ditch attempt to block a vote on the proposal.  In the majority opinion, Judge Paul Wilson wrote bluntly that the case was  not about abortion  but instead what information must be included on initiative petitions.  The legal dispute centered on whether the amendment sufficiently described what laws it would repeal, fulfilling a requirement for ballot measures. Abortion opponents argued it did not, while abortion rights supporters said opponents were misreading the requirement.  Wilson, an appointee of former Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, found that requirement in state law effectively irrelevant because restrictions on the power of initiative petitions can only be found in the constitution.   So, the question is only what the constitution requires,  Wilson wrote, noting that the state Supreme Court has never held that the state constitution requires a petition to identify all state laws that may later be declared invalid.  Chief Justice Mary Russell, Judge Robin Ransom and Judge Brent Powell concurred with the decision.  The amendment would prohibit the General Assembly from banning abortion until fetal viability, defined in the measure as the point in pregnancy when there s a significant chance the fetus can survive outside the womb without extraordinary medical measures.  The amendment allows but does not require, lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability; the GOP-controlled legislature would almost certainly pass a ban on abortions late in pregnancy.  Any post-viability ban would be required to allow at least three exceptions – for the life, physical and mental health of the woman.   Because Amendment 3 does not purport to repeal any existing constitutional provision and is not so utterly and completely inconsistent with any existing constitutional article or section as to constitute a direct conflict or irreconcilable repugnance, Opponents  first challenge fails,  Wilson wrote.  The Missouri Supreme Court s order on Sept. 10 came after Cole County Circuit Court Judge Christopher Limbaugh ruled against the measure after anti-abortion activists filed a lawsuit seeking to toss it from the ballot.  Limbaugh, an appointee of Republican Gov. Mike Parson and a cousin to the late conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, found the amendment didn t comply with a requirement that ballot measures outline what state laws they would repeal.  Lawyers for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the main campaign for the amendment, swiftly appealed the decision to the Missouri Court of Appeals, which in turn handed the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.  Only Judge Kelly Broniec, an appointee of Republican Gov. Mike Parson, dissented. Broniec argued that the state law requiring measures to list statutes that would be repealed is presumed constitutional.   Because Amendment 3 had to follow Missouri law … and did not do so, I would affirm the circuit court s judgment,  Broniec wrote.  Judge Ginger Gooch and Judge Zel Fischer concurred with Broniec s dissent."
5,24,,"Pennsylvanians overwhelmingly trust Kamala Harris more than Donald Trump on abortion, Inquirer/NYT/Siena poll finds",,https://www.inquirer.com/politics/harris-trump-abortion-stance-pennsylvania-poll-voters-20240920.html,"As Vice President Kamala Harris works to build a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans, abortion remains her strongest issue among Pennsylvania voters.  A poll from The Philadelphia Inquirer, New York Times, and Siena College found Harris held a 25-point lead on Trump on the issue with 59% of likely voters trusting her more on the issue, slightly higher than President Joe Biden s lead on the issue in April.  Harris has centered reproductive rights as one of the themes of her campaign as former President Donald Trump has struggled to find a consistent message on the issue.  Even before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, Harris was a key messenger for Democrats on reproductive rights. She proved her strength discussing the issue during her debate against Trump last week. The poll was conducted Sept. 11 to 16, the six days that immediately followed the debate.  The crucial Philly suburbs were especially supportive of Harris on abortion issues as 72% of likely voters in the counties said she was better equipped to handle the issue. The collar counties helped deliver Biden s victory in the state in 2020 and could again determine the outcome this fall.  Discussing abortion while debating Trump in Philadelphia last week Harris focused on the stories of women denied medical care because of state restrictions on the procedure. She also referenced stories of young victims of rape and incest who had to cross state lines to obtain abortion care.   The government, and Donald Trump, certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  Harris said.  That message resonated.   I m Catholic, so I can t say I would actually have an abortion, but I think everybody should have that choice. And not have to be in fear. Or risk their life to do it,  said Jessica Storment, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia who plans to vote for Harris.  Trump, who appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, insisted he did not support federal restrictions on abortion and argued the Dobbs decision rightly returned the issue to states. However, he would not say if he would veto a federal ban on abortion if Congress sent one to his desk.  He sought to paint Harris as extreme, claiming she supports abortions very late in pregnancy — which are extremely rare. Harris has said she supports codifying the abortion protections within Roe v. Wade, which would protect access to abortion until fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy.   They re radical, the Democrats are radical in that,  he said.  Despite Trump s claims to the contrary, the poll found that 49% of Pennsylvanians, including 71% of Philadelphia respondents, believed that Trump would try to pass national restrictions on abortion if elected.  Even supporters of Trump told pollsters they trusted Harris more on abortion.   When it comes to … women s … reproductive health rights, that s the big thing for me. Because you know, things happen whether you plan it or not,  said Kylie Dickens, a 25-year-old from West Grove who plans to vote for Trump.  So, you know, I get definitely nervous on that aspect of him going into office. I don t agree with him on that sense.   A strong majority of likely voters in Pennsylvania support legal access to abortion with 66% of respondents saying abortion should be always or mostly legal. Only 26% said it should be always or mostly illegal.  Reproductive rights will be a key motivating issue for Democrats in November up and down the ballot.  In the Pennsylvania Senate race Republican Dave McCormick has sought to pivot away from abortion, instead talking about reproductive rights from a lens of broadening access to fertility treatment.  Still, 49% of respondents said they trusted the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Bob Casey — 19 percentage points higher than the number who trusted McCormick on the issue."
5,25,,Kamala Harris denounces Trump for abortion bans after ‘preventable’ deaths,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/kamala-harris-denounces-trump-for-abortion-bans-after-preventable-deaths/ar-AA1qVIpV?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris Friday denounced former President Donald Trump for pushing extreme abortion bans after a bombshell new published report called the deaths of two Georgia moms  preventable.   The Democratic presidential nominee slammed Trump for backing restrictive abortion laws like Georgia s, which a state panel said played a  large  role in the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller.   Amber waited 20 hours excruciating hours, until she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they could (legally) treat her,  Harris told hundreds of supporters in suburban Atlanta.  But they couldn t save her.    It s heartbreaking,  Harris added.  Harris derided Trump and vice presidential running mate JD Vance as  hypocrites  and worse for claiming their anti-abortion policies are pro-family.   It should not be Donald Trump or the government telling women what to do with their own bodies,  she said.  How dare he.   The speech came a day after Harris held an emotional meeting with Thurman s family during a town hall with Oprah Winfrey on live television.  Harris choked back emotion after hearing the grieving family recount the story of her death.   I m just so sorry,  Harris told Thurman s mother.  Thurman, the mother of a young boy, died in 2022 after suffering rare complications from abortion medication.  She went to the hospital after suffering severe symptoms, but doctors did not immediately treat her amid fears they could face criminal charges under Georgia s newly enacted Republican law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.  A state medical panel recently ruled Thurman s death as  preventable  and said delays in providing care played a  large  role in her death, Pro Publica reported this week.  Miller, 41, died at home after taking abortion medication when she became pregnant. Relatives say she declined to go to the hospital to seek treatment for fear of being criminally charged under the law.  The state panel also called Miller s death  preventable.   Democrats believe abortion rights is a key issue for them in the 2024 election and Harris has relentlessly pounded Trump on it.  Democrats have enjoyed an uninterrupted string of wins in elections where abortion was a key issue ever since 2022, when the conservative Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that had legalized abortion nationwide.  Voters in several states, including red states like Kansas and Ohio, have voted in favor of abortion rights, and several other states are voting on similar ballot measures in November.  Trump has been put on the defensive by abortion rights-related attacks. He has previously proudly boasted of appointing the three conservative Supreme Court who overturned Roe.  But he has recently stressed that he believes that laws passed by his Republican allies like those in Georgia that ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy are too harsh and also that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.  Despite Trump s claim that he has a more moderate stance on abortion, he still says he will vote against a Florida ballot measure that would restore abortion rights and overturn the Sunshine State s six-week ban.  ________"
5,26,,Harris Speaks To Family Of Woman Who Died Under Georgia Abortion Ban,,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-oprah-winfrey-abortion-rights_n_66ecbbaee4b07a173e50d38d?r7f,"LOADINGERROR LOADING  Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday addressed the family of a young woman who died in what a ProPublica investigation revealed was a preventable death resulting from Georgia s ultra-restrictive abortion law.  It was the first time the family had spoken out since the investigative news outlet reported this week on Amber Nicole Thurman s death after the 28-year-old left the state in 2022 to secure the abortion pill and could not receive the care she needed from a Georgia hospital when a complication arose.  Advertisement   This story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place,  Harris told the woman s mother and sister, who were seated in the audience for a live-streamed campaign event hosted by media mogul Oprah Winfrey.   And in state after state, including yours, these abortion bans have been passed that criminalize health care providers — in a couple of states, prison for life, Oprah, prison for life ... for a doctor or a nurse providing health care,  Harris said, blaming her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, for appointing the U.S. Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022.  Here s the problem with that — so she s on death s door before you actually decide to give her help ... like, literally a doctor or nurse has to say she might die any minute?   The woman s mother, Shanette, spoke out for the first time, delivering an emotional account of losing her daughter in what a medical examiner deemed a preventable death after doctors waited 20 hours to perform a surgical procedure that may have saved her life. Georgia law criminalizes practitioners who perform abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.   I want y all to know Amber was not a statistic,  Shanette said.  She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.   Advertisement  It was a powerful moment during an event that was clearly aimed at undecided suburban women. The live-stream was conducted in an interview format by Winfrey and featured a bevy of stars beaming in from expensive-looking rooms, including Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Chris Rock, Tracee Ellis Ross and Meryl Streep.  Winfrey s questions were tailored to persuadable voters with concerns about reproductive rights, the economy and immigration.  But during one awkward exchange on gun safety and school shootings, Harris declared:  If somebody breaks into my house, they re getting shot.  A moment later, she added:  Probably should not have said that.   Winfrey early on teed up a softball question for Harris on the influx of immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which has been subjected to bomb threats and chaos since Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, baselessly insisted the immigrant population there has been eating neighbors  cats and dogs.  Everybody in America — left, right, middle — has concerns about immigration,  Winfrey said.  Advertisement   I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people,  Harris said before stating she d back the bipartisan bill with resources for the border that Trump instructed congressional Republicans to kill earlier this year.   He preferred a run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,  Harris said of Trump.  He put his personal political security before border security,  Harris added.  Harris appeared before a live audience of 400 people in Oakland County, Michigan ― a swing state where recent polls show Harris leading Trump. Harris  campaign touted before the event that 200,000 people had committed to viewing it online as of Thursday afternoon.

In remarks focused solely on abortion rights, Harris in Atlanta invoked the name of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old Georgia woman who died of an infection after a rare complication from taking medication abortion.   We will speak her name: Amber Nicole Thurman,  Harris said, leading the crowd in a call and response.  Amber Nicole Thurman.   According to a recent ProPublica report, Thurman waited 20 hours in a suburban Atlanta hospital after seeking medical care for an incomplete abortion before doctors tried to give her the treatment she needed.  A state medical board review said she died largely because of the hospital s delay in treating her and called it  preventable.    We understand the impact of these bans, and the horrific reality that women and families, their husbands, their partners, their parents, their children, are facing as a consequence every single day since Roe was overturned,  Harris said.   The reality is, for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many of the stories we re not hearing, but where suffering is happening every day in our country,  she continued.  Thurman s family met with Harris at her  Unite for America  rally Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan.  During her remarks Friday, Harris said she spoke with Thurman s sisters and mother.   I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic,  Harris said.  People will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today.   Trump repeatedly brags about his role in getting Roe overturned, and the speech was part of the Harris campaign s effort to tie the consequences of state abortion bans directly back to him.   Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action,  Harris said, pushing back on Trump s embrace of exceptions to abortion bans.  Think about what we are saying right now. You re saying that good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die.

Thurman, a 28-year-old medical assistant who lived in Georgia, was a single mother of a 6-year-old boy, and one of at least two women who died due to the state s restrictive abortion laws, according to a recent ProPublica article. A second woman, 41-year-old Candi Miller, also died after she reportedly delayed seeking care due to fears over anti-abortion legislation.  Days after the stories were released, Harris returned to Atlanta for a campaign rally centered around the importance of reproductive freedom.  Harris  message echoed what medical providers, Democratic state officials, and reproductive rights advocates across the state have witnessed: Laws that block abortion access, they say, lead to an increase in pregnancy-related deaths that disproportionately impacts Black and brown women, even for those with wanted pregnancies.  Georgia Voter Guide:The key competitive races in the Nov. 5 general election  Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.  In Georgia, those deaths are largely preventable, though the ProPublica story is the first to explicitly link pregnancy-related fatalities to Georgia s abortion ban. A 2023 report from the Georgia Department of Public Health revealed that 89% of pregnancy-related deaths in Georgia had at least some chance of being prevented.  Dr. Michelle Nelson, a professor of nursing at Clayton State University who also serves as the Georgia State Liaison for the American Association of Nursing Practitioners, took the stage to denounce the state s maternal healthcare deserts. Out of the state s 159 counties, 82 do not have a practicing OBGYN, she said.   This abortion ban has created confusion and fear for providers like me in this state,  Nelson said.  Medical students are choosing not to do their residencies here because they are worried that they won t be able to provide appropriate care to their patients. And guess what? We are already in a healthcare shortage.   State Rep. Park Cannon (D-Atlanta), who sits on the Georgia House Democratic Caucus s Committee on Maternal Mortality, also appeared at the rally.  More:Michelle Obama s nonprofit When We All Vote brings registration to voters — and WNBA fans   The families of Amber and Candi, they re forced to mourn someone who should be here today, and this reality exists for so many other families who have run out of options and can t access basic reproductive health care,  Cannon said. She also emphasized the barriers to care that Georgians in rural areas face due to lack of providers and hospital closures.   This issue is exacerbated by the previous administration s unwillingness to care,  she said.  They harmed our Medicaid system, and this session, they opposed Medicaid expansion. Georgia has one of the highest Black maternal mortality rates in the country, and our extreme abortion ban is actually killing women in our state.   During her speech, Harris spoke about Thurman s life, her family and her ambitions, telling the crowd that Thurman s mother had asked for her daughter to be remembered as more than a statistic. Her family said Thurman had just moved into a new apartment with her son, and had her sights set on attending nursing school. She was forced to travel out of state to obtain an abortion, and when she developed complications back home in Georgia, doctors were forced to delay treating her under the new law.   Under the (former President Donald) Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed,  Harris said.  Understand what the law like this means: Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action.   Harris also rejected Trump s efforts to frame abortion as a state s rights issue.   Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom was on the ballot from Kansas to California to Kentucky, in Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom,  Harris concluded.  This is not a partisan issue, and it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again.

Biden didn't.,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/harris-is-saying-all-the-right-things-about-abortion-biden-didnt/ar-AA1qDZug?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"In the June presidential debate, President Joe Biden s answer on the abortion issue made me feel hopeless. His answer was incoherent and failed to capture the gravity of the situation, allowing former President Donald Trump room to spread more ridiculous falsehoods about abortion procedures.  Vice President Kamala Harris made up for it in the September debate. She seemed to understand the importance of humanizing the issue. In a race that is being defined by abortion rights, her answer is exactly what I was hoping to hear from the Democratic presidential nominee.   I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law,  Harris said Tuesday night, definitively staking her position.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Abortion will help decide this election  Harris also took the time to highlight an important fact: Most Americans support abortion access. Pew Research Center has found that 63% of U.S. adults think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.  Eating dogs? It s not who you think: JD Vance ate my dog and Elon Musk ate my cat. Will Trump address this very real issue?  While the economy remains the top issue for most voters, there is a strong contingent of women voters for whom abortion is a major issue.  According to a recent KFF poll, 61% of voters say this election will have a  major impact  on abortion access nationwide.  That s true, especially considering abortion is on the ballot in up to 10 states. Since Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, six states have voted on similar measures. Abortion access has won every time.  Harris managed to quell the fears Biden s debate night answer brought up in me. I hope she maintains a strong stance on the issue into November.  Harris is talking about abortion in all the correct ways  In her answer on abortion, she used anecdotes akin to the stories of the women who spoke on the first night of the Democratic National Convention. The real-life examples stressed the necessity of abortion access in a post-Roe America.   Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest,  Harris said at last week s debate.  Which, understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next.   Can Harris win? Harris obviously won the debate. That won t matter if she loses the election.  Her overall answer was what I had been hoping to see from Harris: one that addressed the harsh realities of the Dobbs decision and the subsequent fallout instead of shying away from a topic that remains one of the top issues of this election cycle.  Trump remains unconvincing and unraveled on abortion  Trump has bragged that he killed Roe. He also recently said he d vote against Florida s six-week abortion ban before changing course in the following days.  At the debate, ABC News moderator Linsey Davis asked him why women should trust him, given the flip-flopping.  Trump responded with an incoherent answer:  Well, the reason I m doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month.   He continued to push the idea that abortions are occurring late in pregnancy – an idea that Harris pushed back on. To be clear, abortions at or after 21 weeks make up only 1% of all abortions in the United States.   Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion,  she said.  That is not happening. It s insulting to the women of America.   Trump even said that Minn. Governor Tim Walz, Harris  running mate, supports  execution after birth.  It is not legal to kill a child who has been born in any state, something that Davis also pointed out during the debate.  Overall, Trump came off sounding deranged. He refused to say whether he would veto a national abortion ban if it were passed by Congress. Sure, it played to his base, but it failed to win over moderates or undecided voters.  For people who care about abortion access nationwide, there is one clear choice for president. Trump is the reason Roe v. Wade no longer exists. Harris can help us codify it into law. Vote accordingly.  Follow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno"
6,32,,"Missouri governor candidates debate abortion, sports betting and immigration",,https://news.yahoo.com/news/missouri-governor-candidates-debate-abortion-225732464.html,"(This story has been updated to correct grammar and typos and to correct what Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kehoe said during the political forum regarding abortion. Kehoe said he would like to provide more resources for adoptions and pregnancy care centers.)  Abortion, sports betting, immigration, school safety and economic development were among the topics discussed during the recent Missouri gubernatorial debate in Springfield.  Hosted by the Missouri Press Association, the Missouri gubernatorial debate was held Friday at The Historic Fox Theatre in downtown Springfield. Republican Mike Kehoe, Democrat Crystal Quade, Libertarian Bill Slantz and Green Party candidate Paul Lehmann participated.  David Lieb of the Associated Press Jefferson City Bureau moderated the forum. He was joined by panelists Alvin A. Reid of the St. Louis American, Christine Temple of the Springfield Business Journal and Lucas Presson of the Southeast Missourian.  During the hour-long forum, the candidates answered 12 questions, each having one minute to provide a response. Candidates were also allotted one minute each for both opening and closing remarks. Though candidates were allowed 30 seconds for rebuttals, none were utilized during the forum.  For members of the public, the debate was livestreamed on The History Museum on the Square s YouTube channel. The video remains available on the YouTube channel, as does the Missouri U.S. Senate debate that followed directly after.  Abortion in Missouri: What did candidates for governor say?  When asked if they support Missouri Constitution Amendment 3, which, if passed, would allow Missouri residents to make and carry out decisions related to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, candidates were split down the middle.  Democratic candidate Crystal Quade and Green Party candidate Paul Lehmann said they support Amendment 3, while Republican Mike Kehoe and Libertarian Bill Slantz said they do not.   The law that we have in Missouri right now is the most extreme in the entire country, without exceptions for rape or incest,  Quade said.  I personally have received phone calls from women who have gone to doctor s offices during an active miscarrying situation and sent home being told they re not close enough to death yet. Our doctors are scared to do their jobs.   Missouri is one of 14 states with a total ban on abortion care in the United States.  Echoing Quade, Lehmann said he will  strongly endorse  Amendment 3 to provide  order and justice for women  in Missouri.  On the other side of the aisle, Kehoe described Amendment 3 as  extreme  and the  most harmful amendment on the ballot.  In supporting Missouri families, Kehoe said he would like to provide more resources for adoptions and pregnancy care centers.  Slantz said he recognizes that every individual s situation is unique and the conversation about abortion should only be had between a patient and a medical professional, not the government. He does not believe the state government should fund abortion care.  Missouri s minimum wage proposal  One of the November ballot measures will ask voters if they would like to raise the state s minimum wage from its current amount of $12.30 per hour to $13.75 per hour in 2025 and $15 per hour by 2026, with annual inflation adjustments in following years. If passed, the legislation would also require paid sick leave.  Kehoe and Slantz do not support the ballot measure, both believing that the state should not set a minimum wage. Kehoe said he believes the economy and businesses should set the minimum wage, while Slantz believes there should be no minimum wage in the state of Missouri at all.  Quade and Lehmann support the ballot measure. Lehmann said the Green Party has put forward a  $25 minimum wage goal  and passing this ballot measure would be working toward that goal. He added that a lack of a minimum wage further suppresses members of the  working poor.   Speaking about the ballot measure, Quade said she wants to  elevate  the importance of the paid sick leave for all Missourians.  Amendment 2 and sports betting in Missouri  Kehoe, Quade and Slantz stated their support for Amendment 2, which if passed, would allow sport wagering, including online sports betting, gambling boats, professional sports betting districts and mobile licenses to sports betting operators. A portion of the revenue made from sports betting would go to public schools and higher education.  Quade and Kehoe agreed that without the sports betting legislation, Missouri is missing out on potential revenue.  Though he supports the constitutional amendment, Slantz said he doesn t wish to put tight restrictions on sports betting, as he believes this would only support large casinos and not local small businesses. He added that he is  offended  that the legislation would fund public education in the state of Missouri.  Lehmann said he does not support the constitutional amendment, adding that when he grew up, it was known that betting and gambling were sins. Lehmann said he finds the efforts to fund Missouri s education through sports betting as  deceptive.   Candidate views on Missouri s budget  Missouri s budget for the current fiscal year is about $50 billion, including state and federal funds, which is about double what the state s budget was 10 years ago. Candidates were asked their thoughts on the size of the state budget and what they think the budget should or should not cover.  Quade described the state s budget as a  moral document,  meaning the government should utilize the budget to invest in the lives of everyday Missourians. Quade said she believes local law enforcement, public education, transportation and roadways, and rural healthcare need more financial support. Kehoe echoed Quade, stating that he believes Missouri s education and public safety industries need to be financially prioritized.  Lehmann said he believes the state budget is not big enough and that there should be a larger priority for education and rural communities.  On the flipside, Slantz said he believes the state budget should be cut in half, if not more. Ultimately, he wishes to eliminate personal property and income taxes, in addition to taxpayer-funded education and social services.  Immigration and the U.S. border  The responses from the four candidates on how they would manage immigration in the state of Missouri varied across the board.  Quade said she would like to support bipartisan immigration legislation at the federal level and on the local level, she would like to provide more support to law enforcement to keep communities safe from drug and human trafficking.  Kehoe, who boasted of his two visits to the Mexico-United States border, described illegal immigration in Missouri as  out of control,  especially with an excess of deadly, illegal drugs like fentanyl, entering the country. Kehoe said he would like to get a handle on the number of undocumented immigrants so state funds can be redirected to Missouri taxpayers.  Slantz said he would like to eliminate all taxpayer funds that benefit immigrants, letting them  support themselves.   Lehmann described all immigrants, documented and otherwise, as a financial  asset  in Missouri and that he would like to create programming to better help integrate immigrants into the state.  State taxes, including tax credit incentives and income taxes  Tax credit incentives and income taxes were both discussed during the political forum.  Missouri tax credit incentives subtracted $669 million from the state treasury in 2023. Candidates were asked to comment on these incentives.  Lehmann expressed support for the state s tax credit incentives. Slantz said he believes tax credits should be eliminated. Quade and Kehoe both said that while they support some tax credit incentives, they believe the state should have more oversight over them.  Missouri s individual income tax credit rate is expected to decline to 4.7% in January. Candidates were asked if they support tax cuts in the state.  Slantz and Kehoe both said they would like to see an individual income tax credit rate that is at 0%. Specifically, Slantz said he would like to see sales and fuel taxes replace income taxes.  Quade expressed an interest in creating the  same tax for all Missourians.  She added that she would like to reduce the state s food tax and taxes on feminine hygiene products and diapers.  Lehmann said he would like to implement a  graduated income tax,  so wealthy Missourians pay a  fair share.   Gun control in Missouri  Generally, Missouri prohibits local governments from enacting their own firearm legislation.  When it comes to gun control throughout the state, Quade and Lehmann agreed that local governments should dictate this legislation. Specifically, Quade said she believes local law enforcement should have the ability to take away firearms from individuals who pose a safety risk to themselves and others. Lehmann said he would like more control on firearms and a ban on assault weapons.  Kehoe and Slantz, on the other hand, do not believe in gun control, both expressing opposition to the infringement of Missourians  Second Amendment rights.  Economic development  When it comes to promoting economic development throughout Missouri, all four candidates expressed an interest in creating more resources for Missourians.  Quade and Kehoe both said they d like to see more promotion of community colleges and tech schools for young individuals who may not be interested in pursuing traditional four-year universities. Quade also said she would like to see an emphasis on infrastructure for working Missourians, including more accessible healthcare and internet.  Slantz said he would like to eliminate business taxes, allowing small businesses to use their revenue to train employees.  Lehmann said he would like to lift restrictions on small businesses and see the creation of universal healthcare for all Missourians.  Candidates address school safety  Candidates were asked two questions about school safety. First, they were asked how they would regulate the growing increase of online threats from juveniles.  Kehoe and Quade both said they d like to increase the number of juvenile officers at schools. Kehoe added that he would like to create more special penalties for juveniles who make online threats. Quade said she would like to emphasize the importance of mental healthcare for troubled students.  Slantz said he believes the state should not create regulations on this issue. Rather, supervision and discipline should be implemented at the  local level, parent level, clergy level,  despite being  virtually impossible today.   A move away from virtual learning and a  return to paper learning,  Lehmann said, is how he believes online threats could be eliminated.  Second, the candidates were asked how they would increase safety within Missouri public schools.  Kehoe and Lehmann both said they would like to see an increase in mental health resources for students. Kehoe added that he would also like for every school to have an adequate number of school resource officers.  In the same vein, Quade said re-emphasized that she believes local law enforcement should have the ability to take away guns that are accessible to individuals — in this case children — who pose a safety threat to themselves and/or others. Quade added that she would like to see an increase in safety infrastructure within schools, such as bulletproof doors and windows.  Slantz restated his interest in eliminating taxpayer-funded education in Missouri and that local communities should  police  the safety within their schools.  Addressing Missouri s  childcare crisis   All candidates agreed that Missouri is undergoing a  childcare crisis.   Describing Missouri s childcare system as  broken,  Lehmann again expressed his interest in universal healthcare in order to better serve Missouri parents and children.  Throughout her eight years in the state legislature, Quade said she has prioritized affordable childcare legislation for Missourians. First and foremost, Quade said she would like to better financially support childcare providers in the state.  Kehoe said he would like to promote the opening of more childcare centers throughout the state, in addition to childcare options at current businesses. He added that he would like to strengthen the state s tax credit for childcare  Slantz said he believes childcare is a local community s issue, not the state government s.

6,33,,Abortion clinics — and patients — are on the move as state laws shift,,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/abortion-clinics-and-patients-are-on-the-move-as-state-laws-shift/ar-AA1qPXAN?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Greetings from St. Louis, where we eagerly await our annual two weeks of autumn. I m KFF Health News Midwest correspondent Bram Sable-Smith. Send your news tips and bluster about the East Coast foliage to me at brams@kff.org.  Today s edition: The Post is out with a new quiz designed to test whether your coronavirus knowledge is up-to-date. Senators are set to vote on contempt charges against the embattled chief executive of Steward Health Care. But first …  In states where abortion remains legal, organizations feel the ripples of every new ban almost instantly  Last month, Planned Parenthood Great Plains opened its newest clinic in Pittsburg, Kan., a city of about 21,000 people mere minutes from the borders of both Missouri and Oklahoma.  It s the second new clinic the regional affiliate has opened in Kansas in a little over two years, to accommodate the growing number of patients coming from Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Louisiana.  For many people in the South, Kansas is now the nearest place to get a legal abortion.  Fourteen states have enacted abortion bans with few exceptions since the Supreme Court s Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization decision in 2022 left policies on abortion to the states. Many more have limited access.  And yet, the estimated number of abortions in the United States last year rose to over 1 million, the highest number in a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a national nonprofit that supports abortion rights. That s due in part to the efforts of groups such as Planned Parenthood Great Plains to fill the void left in the states with bans.  Over 170,000 people traveled out of their own state to receive abortion care in 2023, according to Guttmacher. That s a big jump after Dobbs even though the share of out-of-state patients has been rising since at least 2011.  Not all of the increase in abortions comes from interstate travel, of course. Telehealth has made medication abortions easier to obtain without traveling. The number of self-managed abortions, including those involving the medication mifepristone, has risen.  And Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said the majority of the overall abortion increase in recent years came from those in states without total bans. The increased attention on the issue since Dobbs and efforts to expand access for people in the states with bans bolstered access for people locally as well.   That speaks, in a lot of ways, to the way in which abortion access really wasn t perfect pre-Dobbs,  Maddow-Zimet said.  There were a lot of obstacles to getting care.   Abortion opponents, meanwhile, hailed an estimated drop in the procedure in the 14 states with near-total bans.   It s encouraging that pro-life states continue to show massive declines in their in-state abortion totals, with a drop of over 200,000 abortions since Dobbs,  Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wrote in a statement.  Organizations in states where abortion remains legal feel the ripples of every new ban almost instantly.  One Planned Parenthood affiliate with a clinic in southern Illinois, for example, reported a roughly 10 percent increase in call volume in the two weeks following the enactment of Florida s six-week abortion ban in May. Both sides now await the next round of policy decisions on abortion, which voters will make in November. Ballot initiatives in 10 states could enshrine abortion rights.  KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.  Infectious disease  The Post s Fenit Nirappil and Lauren Weber put together a new online quiz that allows you to test your knowledge of the latest news and statistics about the coronavirus. The tool was designed in consultation with researchers, physicians and public health experts. Try it out here.  On the Hill  Senators to vote on contempt charges against Steward CEO  On tap today: The Senate health committee will vote on whether to hold Steward Health Care CEO, Ralph de la Torre, in contempt after he skipped a hearing last week despite being issued a subpoena.  Lawmakers are set to vote on two resolutions: one directing Senate legal counsel to file a civil suit compelling de la Torre to testify, and the other referring the case to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to criminally prosecute him for not complying with the subpoena. If passed, both resolutions will move to the full Senate for a vote.  Key context: Over the summer, the panel launched a bipartisan investigation into Steward, which owns more than 30 hospitals nationwide and is in bankruptcy proceedings. Community leaders and some health workers have blamed the company s leadership for extravagant payouts while the hospitals struggled to cover mortgages and other expenses.  The view from de la Torre: His legal team argues he  lacks the authority  to speak on Steward s behalf regarding the bankruptcy proceedings and that a federal court order bars him from doing so.  In a letter sent to the committee yesterday, de la Torre s attorney accused lawmakers of making his client  a criminal scapegoat for the systemic failures in Massachusetts  health care system.  The lawyer said that de la Torre would invoke his Fifth Amendment right to refrain from testifying.  The view from the committee: In a joint statement, Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and ranking member Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said de la Torre has  no basis  for evading the subpoena.  It is essential for our Committee to receive this testimony in order to understand the financial downfall of the company and to inform legislative action to prevent similar events from affecting the patients and communities we represent.   Meanwhile, across the Capitol …  The House rejected Speaker Mike Johnson s plan to temporarily fund the government, cranking up tensions around a fast-approaching shutdown deadline, The Post s Jacob Bogage and Marianna Sotomayor report.  Fourteen Republicans joined with Democrats to block Johnson s bill, which combined a six-month extension of federal funds at current spending levels with a measure the House already passed requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote in national elections. It was opposed by the Democratic-led Senate and the White House.  Next steps: Johnson must now pivot and begin negotiations with the Senate, where Democrats are expected to propose a three-month extension of current funding. Without action, most federal government operations would shut down Oct. 1.  In other news from the House ...  The Energy and Commerce Committee advanced a slate of bipartisan health bills to the full House, including a two-year extension of Medicare telehealth flexibilities and a five-year extension of the hospital-at-home program, both set to expire Dec. 31.  The panel also cleared two child online privacy and safety bills, though both measures saw last-minute tweaks that drew criticism from some lawmakers.  Industry Rx  Why Big Tobacco is betting on Trump  As the tobacco industry fights a ban on menthol cigarettes, a subsidiary of Newports maker Reynolds American has quietly emerged as the largest corporate donor to the leading pro-Trump super PAC, The Post s Isaac Stanley-Becker, Dan Diamond and Josh Dawsey report.  The subsidiary, RAI Services Company, has funneled $8.5 million to Make America Great Again Inc., federal records show. The company doesn t appear to have contributed money to groups backing Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.  Why it matters: Big Tobacco s bet on Donald Trump shows how corporate interests believe the former president can be swayed by campaign donations — and brought into line even on issues where he has shown some independence from GOP orthodoxy, according to former U.S. officials and industry lobbyists.  Reynolds executives have already met with Trump multiple times in 2023 and 2024, including a lengthy New York meeting earlier this year where they stressed their concerns over the proposed menthol ban, according to a person familiar with the activity. The Biden administration put the ban on hold after advisers warned the president it could hurt him with Black voters, but the delay may give Trump the final say on the policy if he retakes the White House.  Stephanie Grisham, a former aide to both Trump and his wife, said the GOP standard-bearer will see the Reynolds donations as a sign of  loyalty  and look to return the favor if elected.  It would absolutely weigh on his thinking,  said Grisham, who has publicly disavowed Trump.  State scan  Kentucky governor bans use of conversion therapy, setting up legal battle  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed an executive order banning  conversion therapy  for minors — skirting the Republican-led state legislature and setting up a likely legal challenge, The Post s María Luisa Paúl reports.  Why it matters: Beshear said the new policy, which took effect immediately, is an overdue step to protect children from a widely discredited medical practice that attempts to change a person s sexual orientation or gender identity. The therapy can include procedures such as electric shock, hypnosis and inducing nausea, according to the American Medical Association, which opposes the approach.  Yes, but: Previous attempts to ban conversion therapy in Kentucky have stalled or failed in the state legislature, with opponents arguing that prohibiting the practice tramples parental rights and infringes on freedom of speech. On Wednesday, a slew of legislators and conservative groups took aim at Beshear s use of his executive powers to override Kentucky s legislative branch — and some vowed to challenge the ban in court.  While similar restrictions have gone before judges in the past, their constitutionality has yet to be tested.
