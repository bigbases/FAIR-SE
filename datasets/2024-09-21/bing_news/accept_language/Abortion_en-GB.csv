1,1,,Nuns sue New York over abortion coverage mandate,A group of New York nuns are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to block New York regulation requiring faith-based organizations ...,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/09/22/nuns-sue-new-york-over-abortion-coverage-mandate/,"A group of New York nuns are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to block New York regulation requiring faith-based organizations to cover abortions in their employee health insurance plans.  In a filing Tuesday, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York joined a coalition of Anglican and Catholic nuns, churches and faith-based social ministries in petitioning justices to take up a case challenging a New York State Department of Financial Services  policy that they argue violates their religious beliefs and constitutional rights. The 2017 rule prohibits insurers from excluding coverage for medically necessary abortions.   New York s abortion mandate is so extreme that not even Jesus, Mother Teresa, or Mahatma Gandhi would qualify for an exemption,  said Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit legal group that has signed onto the legal challenge.  The Justices should exempt religious organizations once and for all so they can focus on caring for the most vulnerable.   The nuns initially filed a lawsuit in 2017 challenging the law, claiming that New York initially promised to exempt employers with religious exemptions from the abortion mandate but narrowed the exemption to cover only religious groups that both primarily teach religion.  That meant that many faith-based organizations, like the Sisterhood of Saint Mary, would still be forced to cover abortion care regardless of their religious views.  New York courts rejected the legal challenge, but the religious groups asked the Supreme Court to take their case. In 2021, the Supreme Court reversed unfavorable rulings from New York courts and told them to reconsider the case in response to a landmark victory in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which held the city discriminated against a Catholic group for refusing to work with the organization over its opposition to same-sex couples.  In May, the New York Court of Appeals found that the rule did not violate religious employers  freedom because both the rule and its religious exemption were neutral and generally applicable to all employers.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the New York courts are ignoring the high court s directive stemming from the Fulton decision and are now asking the justices to overturn the regulations.   Religious groups in New York should not be required to provide insurance coverage that violates their deeply held religious beliefs,  attorney Noel J. Francisco said in a statement.  We are asking the Court to protect religious freedom and make clear that the mandate cannot be applied to this diverse group of religious organizations.   A spokesperson for the state Financial Services Department, named the primary defendant in the legal challenge, didn t immediately respond to a request for comment.  In the petition to the high court, the plaintiffs told justices the case is an opportunity to  protect religious liberty  but also  resolve a persistent split about when laws burdening religious exercise trigger strict scrutiny.  They argue that allowing certain religious conduct  for preferred subsets of religious groups  but forbidding others  is a particularly pernicious form of discrimination under the First Amendment.    No one would reasonably say a law is generally applicable if it exempts a religious nursing home that serves only Lutherans, but not one that serves indigent elderly of all faiths,  they wrote.  But that is precisely the position adopted by the New York courts.   If justices agree to take up the legal fight, it would be heard in the court s new term, which begins next month."
1,2,,Iowa Poll: Most Iowans oppose state's 6-week abortion ban law now in effect,"Most Iowans oppose the state’s 6-week abortion ban, results show in the first Iowa Poll since the state Supreme Court ruled ...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/09/22/most-iowans-support-legal-abortion-oppose-iowas-six-week-ban-new-iowa-poll-shows-fetal-heartbeat-law/75180451007/,"(This story has been updated to change a photo selection and to clarify the definition of the  fetal heartbeat  law.)  © Copyright 2024, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.  A majority of Iowans oppose the state s new  fetal heartbeat  law, which bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, according to a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll.  The poll found that 59% of Iowans — including 69% of women — disapprove of the new restrictions. It found 37% of Iowans favor the new law, and 5% are not sure.  This latest Iowa Poll is the first test of Iowans  views on abortion since the state s six-week ban went into effect July 29.  Iowans  support for abortion rights has continued to rise since the pandemic and in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Iowa Poll results show.  Now, 64% of Iowa adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a new high since the Iowa Poll began asking the question in 2008. That compares with 33% who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases and 3% who are not sure.  This poll of 811 Iowans was conducted by Selzer & Co. from Sept. 8-11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.  The new  fetal heartbeat  law, which is among the most restrictive in the nation, prohibits abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected in a pregnancy and includes narrow exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities and to save the life of the pregnant woman.  It replaced Iowa s previous law, which allowed abortions until about 20 weeks.  The poll found widespread disapproval of the new law among many groups of Iowans, including 91% of Democrats, 88% of suburban women, 78% of those who identify with no religious group and 71% of all suburban adults.  Among the half-dozen demographic groups likely to favor the six-week ban are Republicans (67%), evangelicals (58%), fathers of children younger than 18 (54%) and residents of the 4th Congressional District, married men and white men with college degrees (each at 50%).  GOP-controlled Legislature passes 6-week ban in 2023; court gives green light this year  Iowa s hotly contested abortion ban was passed by the Republican-majority Iowa Legislature in a marathon one-day special session last year. The law was blocked by a legal challenge until earlier this year, when the Iowa Supreme Court ordered an injunction on the ban to be lifted.  More than two in three Iowa women (69%) oppose the law, compared with 27% who favor the ban. Four percent are not sure.  Tiara Soupene, a 27-year-old poll respondent from Tiffin, is among those who oppose the abortion ban. As a nurse who cares for women in pregnancy, she said cutting off access to abortion care would mean more women put at risk.   I know the outcome,  said Soupene, a self-identified Democrat.  I know how easily an ectopic pregnancy can rupture, and then you can go septic or you can bleed to death.   Soupene is also a trained sexual assault nurse examiner who handles rape kits for women after they ve been sexually assaulted. Even with the new ban s exceptions, she fears that those who become pregnant won t be able to get abortion care because they ll be unable to prove the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.   I m worried we ll get to the point where people will say,  Well, how do you know that for sure? Where really is the proof?   she said.  Attitudes toward Iowa s new abortion law are closely split among Iowa men, with 48% opposing the law. 46% in favor and 6% who are unsure.  Poll respondent Eric May, a 63-year-old Cedar Rapids resident and self-identified Republican, supports Iowa s six-week ban.  May, an evangelical, says he believes abortion is murder in any circumstances and does not support any exceptions. Although he said he would like to see a law that bans abortion at conception, May believes Iowa s current law is the  best we can attain today under the political environment we re in.    This was fought tooth and nail to get where we re at today,  said May, who works as a telecommunications technician.  Even if with the strong majorities (in the Iowa Legislature) that we currently have that got the six-week ban into place, getting a ban closer to conception is going to be very difficult.   Support for legal abortion continues to grow among Iowans  The 64% of Iowans who support legal abortion includes 25% who say it should be legal in all cases and 39% who say it should be legal in most cases.  By comparison, the 33% of Iowans who oppose abortion includes 26% who say it should be illegal in most cases and 7% who say it should be illegal in all cases; 3% are not sure.  The Iowa Poll has measured Iowans  views on abortion seven times since September 2018, and once before in 2008, with the latest findings showing the highest support.  In a March 2023 Iowa Poll, the most recent test of this issue, 61% of Iowans said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 35% said it should be illegal in most or all cases.  Poll respondent Jessa Bears, a 38-year-old farmer living in Farragut, is an abortion rights supporter who said she believes the government shouldn t have a say in a person s decision to seek the procedure.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, nearly two-dozen states have enacted greater restrictions on abortion. Bears, a self-identified Democrat, said watching these laws be passed has been  terrifying.   Bears worries that Iowa s law could exacerbate challenges to recruit health care providers for rural communities, which already face a severe shortage of maternity care. She said her community has an emergency room, but if she needs care from an urgent care clinic or a specialty physician, she must drive at least an hour away.   There s just so many gray areas in medical decisions that to have these black-and-white laws just make no sense to me,  she said.  You paint it with a broad brush, and it s going to cause problems — a lot more problems than I think they even realize when they re passing the dang law.   Support for legal abortion is heavily split among party lines, with 92% of Democrats saying they support abortion in all or most cases and 7% saying abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.  By comparison, a majority of Republicans, 63%, say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Thirty-two percent say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.  Independents, by contrast, are much more supportive of abortion rights, with 70% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases and 26% saying it should be illegal in all or most cases.  Corey Baldwin, a 51-year-old poll respondent living in Ridgeway, is a self-identified Republican who believes abortion should be illegal in most cases. He said he believes abortion should be restricted to certain circumstances, such as rape, incest or to preserve the life of the pregnant woman.  However, Baldwin s thoughts on Iowa s six-week ban are complicated.  The self-employed truck driver has four daughters, and he agrees most women likely wouldn t know they are pregnant before six weeks. But he said he doesn t agree that abortions should take place much later in pregnancy.   Maybe six weeks is too short,  Baldwin said.  It s a tough topic. There s pros and cons on both sides, but my biggest thing is that I just don t think (abortion) should be used as birth control.   Iowa Supreme Court s approval rating tied to Iowans  abortion views  The Iowa Poll also tested Iowans  opinions of the Iowa Supreme Court, which cleared the way for the state s abortion ban to go into effect earlier this year.  About half, 49%, of poll respondents say they approve of the state Supreme Court, while 33% disapprove and 18% are not sure.  The latest poll shows Iowans  views on abortion are tied to their approval of the justices.  Sixty-nine percent of those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases say they approve of the state s top court. Fourteen percent say they disapprove, and 18% are not sure.  A plurality of those who support legal abortion disapprove of the Iowa Supreme Court (44%), while 39% approve and 17% of that group are not sure.  May, the poll respondent from Cedar Rapids, said he approves of the Iowa Supreme Court primarily because of its recent ruling on the six-week abortion ban.   I am in favor of what they re currently doing, and the fact that they did allow it to go through,  May said.  Bears, the poll respondent from Farragut, disapproves of the Iowa Supreme Court, saying she believes the justices were  playing politics  in allowing Iowa s stricter abortion law to go into effect.   It happened relatively quickly after the federal Supreme Court ruling, so I feel it was already loaded in the cannon, ready to pull the trigger as soon as they had the means. Then, boom, it was done,  she said.  These new findings on the court s job performance show little change from July 2022, the last time the Iowa Poll tested this issue. At that time, 48% of Iowans approved of the court, while 28% disapproved.  In the February 2019 Iowa Poll, 59% of Iowans approved of the state Supreme Court, while 14% disapproved.

About the Iowa Poll  The Iowa Poll, conducted Sept. 8-11, 2024, for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 811 Iowans ages 18 or older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.  Questions based on the sample of 811 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents—such as by gender or age—have a larger margin of error.

1,3,,Democrats Are the Real Abortion Radicals | Opinion,Why is so much of the media covering for the extreme abortion positions of Harris and most of the Democratic Party?,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-are-the-real-abortion-radicals-opinion/ar-AA1qQqP7?ocid=BingNewsVerp," The majority of Americans believe in a woman s right to make decisions about her own body,  Vice President Kamala Harris stated emphatically on the debate stage in Philadelphia.  Harris was not lying when she made that point, but what she was concealing—and what many in the media have been concealing, too—is the consensus that s grown within the American public about not just a woman s right to an abortion, but about limits on how long that right should extend into a pregnancy.  A look back at Gallup s polling in 2022 on the issue reveals that a record-high 69 percent of Americans support the right, and there were endless headlines reporting that news. But there was no media fanfare about Gallup s polling on limits to a woman s right to an abortion, and we know the reason why: the outcome was inconvenient. It turns out that after 14 weeks of pregnancy, Americans  support for abortion plunged in the Gallup polling. By 24 weeks—six months into a pregnancy term—the bottom fell out, with nearly two-thirds of Americans against. Two-thirds.  Gallup reported in its 2022 summary that Americans are twice as likely to say abortions at 24 weeks should be illegal—a true American consensus that Harris, the Democratic Party, and most of the mainstream media ignored.  Dig a bit deeper, and the abortion polling gets even more interesting. Gallup data made clear that there are more extremists on the pro-choice side of the aisle: a stunning 19 percent believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while a mere 8 percent believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. And surprise, surprise, that cold hard fact got no media play either.  And so the question remains: why is so much of the media covering for the extreme abortion positions of Harris and most of the Democratic Party—while having no problem reporting the supposedly more extreme position of their political rivals?  It is not just the polling consensus on abortion from the American people that has gone underreported; it s Harris  real-life abortion voting record as a U.S. senator from California—and that of the Democratic Party as a whole.  Let s review that voting history—and by all means, click the embedded links to see the congressional voting rolls for yourself.  During her time as U.S. senator, as former U.S. consul to Bermuda Lee Rizzuto explained in a Daily Caller column, Harris voted not once but twice against S.311 (the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act). The bill would have prohibited health care practitioners, to quote the legislative language,  from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.  In 2019, 53 senators voted for the bill, including three Democrats (Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia), and 44 voted against—none of the Republicans—leaving the bill short of the 60 Senate votes needed to make it law.  Harris also voted in February of 2020 against S. 3275 (the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act) which would have banned late-term abortions after five months of pregnancy—the point at which unborn children can feel pain. The vote tally was again 53 yeas (including only two Democrats) and 44 nays.  In addition, Harris  party nearly unanimously backed the radical Women s Health Protection Act, a bill that reads like a manifesto for unlimited and unrestricted abortion rights through all nine months of the pregnancy.  The bill, which both House and Senate Democrats have tried to pass, permits late-term abortion procedures on nearly fully formed children.  This inhumane bill has become the Democrat Party s standard,  Rizzuto writes.  It garnered a whopping 99% support from House Democrats in both 2021 and 2022, passing the House by 218-211 and 219-210 respectively, with only one Democrat voting against it both years.   But things get even worse when you see how the Democrats, their allies, and the media spin these matters. Consider the Guttmacher Institute, a leading voice on the abortion activist front. A look at their national map of state abortion policies reveals just how out of step they are with the American public when it comes to abortion limits.  The map is color coded, with each color representing differing categories, from most restrictive to most protective. What s most interesting is what the institution considers  restrictive.  Click on the  restrictive  state of Pennsylvania, and you ll discover that abortion is legally permissible up to 24 weeks (the sixth month of pregnancy), a limit the vast majority of Americans would not describe as  restrictive.  Click the  restrictive  state of Wisconsin, and you ll find that abortion in the state is legal up to 22 weeks. Kansas, another  restrictive  state, is 22 weeks, too. Click Virginia—another  restrictive  state—and you ll discover abortions are legal until the end of the second trimester. Wyoming, another  restrictive  state, is 24 to 26 weeks. That s up to two weeks into the sixth month of pregnancy.  Maybe abortion activists should have a conversation with the voters in those so-called  restrictive  states—and the vast majority of Americans who agree with them when it comes to limits to abortion rights—and recalibrate their definitions.  It s also time for the GOP to have a conversation with the American people about abortion extremism in the Democratic Party, and how Kamala Harris, nonprofit activist groups, and their allies in the mainstream media are out of step with the vast majority of Americans when it comes to limits on abortion.  Rizzuto is one of the few GOP leaders to take a public and pragmatic stand on abortion, pointing a way forward for the party to best communicate the extreme nature of its opponents.  Abortion laws should be left up to each individual state. Late-term abortions should not be permitted,  Rizzuto explains.  If the American public understood that these two sentences encapsulate the policies of the GOP and how horrific the policies of the Democrats are, they would support the GOP on this issue.   Voters will decide in November where they stand on this issue. Without strong GOP messaging on the extreme positions of the Democratic Party as it relates to abortion limits—and just how far from mainstream American opinion Harris and the Democratic Party actually are—it may just cost the GOP the election.

1,4,,"Euphoric two years ago, US anti-abortion movement is now divided and worried as election nears","Just two years ago, leading anti-abortion activists were euphoric after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v.",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/euphoric-two-years-ago-us-anti-abortion-movement-is-now-divided-and-worried-as-election-nears/ar-AA1qXfUl?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Just two years ago, leading anti-abortion activists were euphoric as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, thus ending the nationwide right to abortion.  Now, with a presidential election fast approaching, their movement is disunited and worried. Within their own ranks, there is second-guessing and finger-pointing, plus trepidation that Election Day might provide new proof that their cause is broadly unpopular.  Michael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at The Catholic University of America, offered an overview of how the movement had fared since the Roe ruling in June 2022.   Things have not necessarily unfolded as we would hope,  he wrote in an email to The Associated Press.  There is certainly a sense among pro-life leaders that we should have had a stronger post-Roe game plan in place.    I always remind fellow pro-lifers that we were never promised a smooth glide path to victory,  he added.  There will certainly be setbacks and disappointments along the way.   A key reason for the wariness is the anti-abortion movement s recent losing streak on abortion-related ballot measures in seven states, including conservative Kansas and Kentucky. Nine more states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights in the Nov. 5 election — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. In several of them, abortion opponents tried various unsuccessful strategies for blocking the measures.   Pro-life people don t wear rose-colored glasses; we know we have a huge task ahead of us,  Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told the AP.  Because of the massive amounts of money being dumped into the ballot measures from those allied with the abortion industry and the Democratic Party, it s an uphill battle.    We will continue to educate, to make people aware of the catastrophic result if these measures pass,  she added.  I have not seen flagging energy or any loss of determination among pro-life people.   Texas is among the Republican-governed states that have enacted near-total abortion bans. Yet nationally, Texas Right to Life president John Seago said, the anti-abortion movement  is in a critical chapter right now.    Following a historic legal victory, we have realized that while we had enjoyed massive legislative and legal victories in the last decade, public opinion had not followed the same trajectory,  he added.  Troy Newman, who heads the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, recently published an online opinion piece assailing the movement he s been a part of for 25 years.   The tide has turned, and the pro-life message is now considered a political liability that could prevent President Trump s victorious return to the White House,  Newman wrote.   After evaluating the terrible mistakes of the pro-life movement over the last several years, I can only conclude that it is our fault,  Newman wrote.  We have had over 50 years to change the culture s position on abortion only to have failed miserably.   In an interview with the AP, Newman blamed those in his own ranks for the predicament — saying some anti-abortion leaders should have been more adamant in their positions.  We lose the minute we stop focusing on the babies,  he said.  Kristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life of America, suggested via email that Newman s views were ill-suited to the post-Roe era. She said the students in her organization were embracing the challenges of a state-by-state playing field.  But she acknowledged the magnitude of the challenges.   I actually believe the biggest threat is ourselves — our mindsets — which will lead to decreased recruitment, training, and mobilization of our grassroots army of love,  she wrote recently in the conservative outlet Townhall.   Look at the struggles we face this fall with several late-term abortion ballot referendums,  she added.  Most will likely be a political loss for our movement because, in most states, a politically sophisticated, organized, and well-funded state-wide movement is not present.   Hawkins also acknowledged the anger among some anti-abortion activists over the inconsistent rhetoric on abortion coming from the Republican presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.   I m not here to make apologies for the Campaign and their political miscalculations, which are dividing us and could very well lead to their defeat,  wrote Hawkins.  Trump nominated the Supreme Court members who were crucial to overturning Roe and called it  a beautiful thing to watch  as various states took different directions. He has been evasive on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if Congress approved one; his  leave it to the states  approach conveys acceptance of the current patchwork map in which abortion is widely available in at least half the states.  Eligible to vote in Florida, Trump has criticized as too restrictive a new state law banning abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy. But he said he would vote against the ballot measure that would make abortion legal until fetal viability.  Trump s support for a state-by-state solution was a factor in the decision of Charles Camosy, an anti-abortion Catholic academic, to declare he now feels politically estranged.   The Republican Party has rejected our point of view. Democrats are running a candidate ( Kamala Harris ) who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign,  Camosy, a medical humanities professor at Creighton University School of Medicine, wrote recently in The Atlantic.   Pro-lifers — those who believe that protecting vulnerable and unborn life should be a primary policy priority — now do not fit in either major political party.   In an interview, Camosy said abortion-rights supporters were better prepared for the post-Roe era than their adversaries   They were well-funded, they developed key relationships with the media,  Camosy said, while some Republican-controlled legislatures – in his view -- went too far with stringent abortion bans.   I see this moment as an opportunity,  Camosy wrote in The Atlantic.  Pro-life 3.0 must welcome people from multiple political and policy perspectives, working for both prenatal justice and social support for women and families.   Some other anti-abortion activists have forcefully renounced Trump, including leaders of End Abortion Ohio.   We call on God-fearing American voters to withhold their votes from Trump until he evidences genuine repentance for his pro-abortion stance,  said the group s executive director, Nicholas Kallis.  However, Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis is encouraging support for Trump.   A vast majority of our statewide membership absolutely support President Trump and believe he would advance the protection of life at the federal level ... more than a Kamala administration would,  he said.  It is not even close.   Other anti-abortion leaders have made similar calculations.  One example: Back in April, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said she was  deeply disappointed  in Trump s willingness to leave abortion policy to the states.  These days, in a move potentially benefiting Trump, the group plans a $92 million voter outreach program in battleground states depicting Harris and other Democratic candidates as  extremists  on abortion.   It is imperative that the pro-life movement fully unify and mobilize to defeat this threat,  Dannenfelser said.  Among those embracing Trump is Frank Pavone, who continues to lead Priests for Life despite being defrocked in 2022 after feuding with his bishop over his anti-abortion and partisan political activities.   Trump has brought in far more people than he has alienated,  Pavone said via email.  His statements have blunted the effectiveness of the dire, scare-mongering Democrat warnings that the Republicans will ban all abortions.   ___"
1,5,,Federal judge temporarily blocks Tennessee's 'abortion trafficking' law,A federal judge has temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing a law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-tennessee-s-abortion-trafficking-law/ar-AA1qXREh?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"A federal judge Friday temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing a law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission.  In a 49-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger argued that the Republican-controlled state cannot  make it a crime to communicate freely  about legal abortion options even in a state where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy except for a handful of situations. Trauger s decision means that the law will be placed on hold as the case make its way through court.   The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is  abortion trafficking,  the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,  Trauger wrote.  Earlier this year, Tennessee s Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on a proposal making it illegal for an adult who  intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports  a pregnant child or teen within the state to get an abortion without consent from the minor s parents or guardians. Those convicted of breaking the law risked being charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires a nearly one-year jail sentence.  The law, which went into effect July 1, did not contain exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents or guardians. Instead, the statute dictated that biological fathers who cause the pregnancy of their daughters, if minors, couldn t pursue legal actions.  The Tennessee law mimicked the so-called  abortion trafficking  law enacted in Idaho last year, the first state to ever enact such a statute. However, a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho s version as the case moves through court.  Just before the law was poised to go into effect, Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court s decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.  Behn called the Tennessee ruling a  monumental victory for free speech and the fight for abortion rights.   This ruling doesn t just protect Tennesseans — it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,  she said.  A spokesperson for attorney general s office, which was fighting to get the case dismissed, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  Trauger s decision sided with Welty and Behn s argument that the Tennessee law was  unconstitutionally vague,  specifically stressing that the word  recruits  is undefined in the statute.  Trauger also raised several 1st Amendment concerns in her explanation that her ruling would apply across the state.   The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,  Trauger wrote.  Tennessee bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, but there are exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, and to remove a miscarriage or to save the life of the mother. Notably, doctors must use their  reasonable medical  judgment — a term that some say is too vague and can be challenged by fellow medical officials — in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury.  A group of women is suing in a separate case to clarify the state s abortion ban. A court decision is expected soon on whether the lawsuit can continue or if Tennessee s abortion ban can be placed on hold as the legal battle continues.  Kruesi writes for the Associated Press."

Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for medical treatment following the use of abortion pills, marking the first publicly reported case of a woman dying due to delayed care associated with state abortion restrictions. Similarly, Candi Miller, who suffered from lupus, diabetes, and hypertension, also died after taking pills ordered online.  An autopsy revealed fetal tissue that had not been expelled; however, the state s maternal mortality review committee did not attribute her death to the medication.  Experts emphasize that the abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, remain safe and effective options for terminating early pregnancies. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, demonstrating a high success rate of 97.4% for completing an abortion. While there are rare instances of excessive bleeding that may require emergency care, the FDA has repeatedly reaffirmed the drug s safety profile.  Over the years, the agency has eased many restrictions on mifepristone, culminating in a 2021 decision that allowed the medication to be mailed directly to patients.  The deaths of Thurman and Miller come at a time when abortion access is a contentious issue across the country. Critics of the current regulations argue that the FDA s easing of restrictions has contributed to an increase in emergency complications. However, medical professionals counter that only a tiny fraction of patients—less than 0.32%—experience major adverse effects.  Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, notes that many ER visits following medication abortions do not necessarily indicate serious complications. Instead, patients often seek reassurance or answers to their questions rather than requiring immediate medical intervention.  Harris s upcoming address underscores the urgent need for informed discussions about reproductive health in a state struggling with strict abortion laws and the tragic consequences they can produce. Advocates for mifepristone highlight that its safety profile is comparable to many common medications, such as ibuprofen while arguing safety is critical to ensure continued access to these health resources.  The situation in Georgia not only highlights individual tragedies but also illustrates the broader national discourse on abortion access and the implications of restrictive laws on women s health outcomes.  As Harris prepares to speak, the stakes are high for women across the country.  This article includes reporting from The Associated Press"
1,7,,A dramatic rise in pregnant women dying in Texas after abortion ban,"Exclusive analysis finds the rate of maternal deaths in Texas increased 56% from 2019 to 2022, compared with just 11% ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/pregnancy-deaths-rose-by-56-in-texas-after-2021-abortion-ban-exclusive-analysis-shows/ar-AA1qVFAy?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"The number of women in Texas who died while pregnant, during labor or soon after childbirth skyrocketed following the state s 2021 ban on abortion care — far outpacing a slower rise in maternal mortality across the nation, a new investigation of federal public health data finds.  From 2019 to 2022, the rate of maternal mortality cases in Texas rose by 56%, compared with just 11% nationwide during the same time period, according to an analysis by the Gender Equity Policy Institute. The nonprofit research group scoured publicly available reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shared the analysis exclusively with NBC News.   There s only one explanation for this staggering difference in maternal mortality,  said Nancy L. Cohen, president of the GEPI.  All the research points to Texas  abortion ban as the primary driver of this alarming increase.    Texas, I fear, is a harbinger of what s to come in other states,  she said.  The SB 8 effect  The Texas Legislature banned abortion care as early as five weeks into pregnancy in September 2021, nearly a year before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the case that protected a federal right to abortion — in June 2022.  At the time, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, lauded the bill as a measure that  ensures the life of every unborn child.   Texas law now prohibits all abortion except to save the life of the mother.  The passage of Texas  Senate Bill 8 gave GEPI researchers the opportunity to take an early look at how near-total bans on abortion — including cases in which the mother s life was in danger — affected the health and safety of pregnant women.  The SB 8 effect, Cohen s team found, was swift and stark. Within a year, maternal mortality rose in all racial groups studied.  Among Hispanic women, the rate of women dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after increased from 14.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 to 18.9 in 2022. Rates among white women nearly doubled — from 20 per 100,000 to 39.1. And Black women, who historically have higher chances of dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after, saw their rates go from 31.6 to 43.6 per 100,000 live births.  While maternal mortality spiked overall during the pandemic, women dying while pregnant or during childbirth rose consistently in Texas following the state s ban on abortion, according to the Gender Equity Policy Institute.   If you deny women abortions, more women are going to be pregnant, and more women are going to be forced to carry a pregnancy to term,  Cohen said.  Beyond the immediate dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, there is growing evidence that women living in states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas, are far more likely to go without prenatal care and much less likely to find an appointment with an OB-GYN.  Doctors say the feeling among would-be moms is fear.   Fear is something I d never seen in practice prior to Senate Bill 8,  said Dr. Leah Tatum, an OB-GYN in private practice in Austin, Texas. Tatum, who was not involved with the GEPI study, said that requests for sterilization procedures among her patients doubled after the state s abortion ban.  That is, women prefer to lose their ability to ever have children over the chance that they might become pregnant following SB 8.   Patients feel like they re backed into a corner,  Tatum said.  If they already knew that they didn t want to pursue pregnancy, now they re terrified.   Tatum said she s seeing many women in their late 30s and 40s who, even though they d like to have a child, worry they wouldn t have an option to end the pregnancy if it turned out that the baby wouldn t be born healthy.   What happens if I end up with a genetically abnormal fetus?   Tatum said her patients have asked her. They worry their options are limited, she said.   Treated like a criminal   That unthinkable tragedy happened to Kaitlyn Kash, 37, of Austin, Texas.  Kash had a textbook pregnancy with her first child, a healthy little boy, born in 2018.   It d been so easy the first time,  she said.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think we would go down the journey that we went down.   When she became pregnant again, it wasn t until Kash s second trimester, at 13 weeks, that she and her husband, Cory, discovered that their fetus had severe skeletal dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder affecting bone and cartilage growth. It was highly unlikely the baby would survive.   We were told that his bones would break in utero and he would suffocate at birth,  Kash said.  We were expecting our doctor to tell us how we were going to care for our baby, how we were going to end his pain.   It was October 2021, just a month after Texas passed the SB 8 abortion law.   We were told that we should get a second opinion, but make sure that it was outside of Texas,  she said.  At 15 weeks, Kash had to travel to Kansas to terminate her doomed pregnancy. Outside the medical clinic, protesters harassed the grief-stricken mom.   I was being treated like a criminal,  she said.  I didn t get the dignity that I deserved to say goodbye to my child.    It s just another example of how it s heartbreaking to practice in the state of Texas,  Tatum said.  These patients are asking for help. The state of Texas has failed women. "
1,8,,"Cannabis, abortion and the border on state ballots","Notably, abortion will appear on ballots in 10 states this year. It’s an issue proven to draw voters, evidenced in the ...",https://news.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-abortion-border-state-ballots-150000846.html,"(NewsNation) — The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has dominated national headlines, but voters can also expect to see more localized ballot initiatives in November.  Voters in several states will make consequential choices on issues like abortion, election systems, same-sex marriage, border laws and cannabis.  How to register to vote  The outcome of some measures may impact the presidential race in those states.  Notably, abortion will appear on ballots in 10 states this year. It s an issue proven to draw voters, evidenced in the so-called  blue wave  that turned out for the 2022 midterm elections after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier that year.  Here s a look at some of the most common ballot measures voters will decide in November:  Abortion  Border  Cannabis  Abortion  Rank choice voting  Noncitizen voting  Abortion  Efforts to enshrine abortion access are on the ballot in a record 10 states this year — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota.  Meanwhile, voters in Nebraska will decide between a pair of dueling constitutional amendments, one of which seeks to ban abortion after the first trimester — with exceptions. The state already bans abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and requires patients to wait 24 hours after mandated counseling before they obtain an abortion.  The ballot initiatives would generally secure a person s right to an abortion and block laws that restrict or ban access to abortion services. Some proposals, like Arizona s Proposition 139, include specific language defining fetal viability, but each leaves that determination to a patient s health care provider.  Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot measures  Although they all seek to protect abortion access, the proposals  language and tactics vary. Places like Maryland and Missouri would more broadly guard a person s right to make decisions about the prevention, continuation or ending of their pregnancy. In Missouri, that would include a right to make and carry out decisions about  prenatal care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions.   New York Proposal 1 doesn t specifically mention abortion but could protect access to it through broadened antidiscrimination laws. It would amend part of the state constitution that protects against  unequal treatment based on race, color, creed and religion.  If approved, the proposal would include language to also protect against  unequal treatment based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes, as well as reproductive healthcare and autonomy.  New York lawmakers have debated revising the proposal to directly address abortion rights.  Colorado Amendment 79 additionally seeks to repeal an existing ban on state and local funding for abortion services.  Border  Arizona s Proposition 314 would create new state crimes surrounding several border- and immigration-related issues. If passed, the measure would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state anywhere other than through a port of entry and would allow state judges to order deportations. State and local police would also be allowed to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization.  The measure would make it a Class 2 felony for an adult to knowingly sell fentanyl that results in another person s death. Notably, a person could argue the merit of those charges if they show the fentanyl s precursor chemicals were manufactured in the U.S. or lawfully imported into the country.  Proposition 314 would also require people seeking certain public benefits to use an E-Verify program to confirm their immigration status. Submitting false information during that process — or giving false information to an employer to avoid eligibility questions — would also be a crime.  Cannabis  Ballot initiatives in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota will ask voters to legalize the recreational use of cannabis.  Florida s Amendment 3 would legalize recreational pot use for people 21 years and older and would allow for possession of as much as three ounces.  South Dakota s Initiated Measure 29 and North Dakota s Initiated Measure 5 would both legalize recreational cannabis. If passed, North Dakota s measure would allow people to possess as much as one ounce of pot, four grams of concentrate and 300mg of edibles. It would also allow residents to grow three cannabis plants or six plants per household.  Recreational marijuana use is already legal in 24 states.  Wages  Workers could see increased pay and added benefits in some states if voters pass wage-related ballot initiatives.  Measures in Alaska and Missouri would raise the hourly minimum wage to $15, while a California proposal would raise the minimum wage to $18 per hour. Alaska s current minimum wage is $11.73 per hour as of Jan. 1. Missouri and Alaska pay their workers a minimum hourly rate of $12.30 and $11.73, respectively.  Massachusetts  Question 5 also proposes steadily raising the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the state minimum wage by 2029.  In Nebraska, Initiative 436 would require employers to offer as many as seven or at least 20 days of paid sick leave, depending on the company s size.  Meanwhile, tipped workers in Arizona could see their hourly rate reduced. Proposition 138 would allow employers to pay tipped workers 25% less than minimum wage if they earn the state minimum plus $2 per hour for all hours worked.  Rank choice voting  The option to adopt rank choice voting will be on the ballot in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Alaska and Missouri.  The model allows voters to rank candidates by preference. A candidate who receives more than half of the No. 1 slots wins. Races that don t result in a majority winner continue to a runoff election, where the contender with the fewest votes is eliminated until a majority winner is clear.  Maine, New York City, Cambridge, Minneapolis and San Francisco already use the model, and Alaska held its first ranked voting election in 2022.  How do Donald Trump, Kamala Harris  net worths compare?  Voters in other states will also weigh potential changes to the election process. Ballot initiatives in Montana and South Dakota would introduce top-four and top-two ranked choice-style primaries, respectively.  Arizona s Proposition 140 would similarly replace the existing partisan primaries with a system that allows all candidates to appear on one ballot before the top choices advance to the general election. An opposing Arizona measure, Proposition 133, would ban open primaries and ranked voting methods.  Noncitizen voting  Voters in eight states — Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin — will weigh in on proposed noncitizen voting bans.  Voting in a federal election as a noncitizen has been a crime for more than a century and is punishable by fines and prison. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, are also banned from voting in state and most local elections, except for select municipalities.  The issue gained renewed traction as a Republican talking point earlier this year after former President Donald Trump suggested without evidence that Democrats were encouraging people to enter the United States without authorization.  Each U.S. state already has laws criminalizing noncitizen voting. The November ballot measures seek to bolster those bans by reflecting them in the states  constitutions. They would also block local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote.  Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

1,9,,Mother of woman who died after delayed abortion care speaks out at Harris-Oprah event: ‘Amber was not a statistic’,The mother of a woman who died after waiting 20 hours for emergency medical care for an infection caused by an abortion pill ...,https://www.msn.com/en-nz/health/other/mother-of-woman-who-died-after-delayed-abortion-care-speaks-out-at-harris-oprah-event-amber-was-not-a-statistic/ar-AA1qUQKO?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"The mother of a woman who died after waiting 20 hours for emergency medical care for an infection caused by an abortion pill complication shared her daughter s heartbreaking final moments at a Thursday evening rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan.   Initially I did not want the public to know my pain,  Amber Nicole Thurman s mother, Shanette Williams, told the audience at the Unite America rally, where Harris was joined by Oprah Winfrey.  I wanted to go through it in silence, but I realized that it was selfish.  Thurman, a 28-year-old medical assistant, died two years ago after doctors at Piedmont Henry Hospital in the Atlanta suburbs waited 20 hours before performing a procedure called dilation and curettage to treat a rare complication she d suffered after taking abortion medication. She d arrived at the hospital after vomiting blood and passing out, ProPublica reports, and doctors had quickly determined that her uterus had not expelled all of the fetal tissue in her body.  Thurman died on the operating table, with a state committee comprised of 10 doctors later calling her death  preventable.   Her death came as doctors were grappling with Georgia s new abortion laws, which made the dilation and curettage procedure a felony offense in most cases.  This week, Harris blamed the tragedy on  Trump s abortion bans,  insisting they are  preventing doctors from providing basic medical care.  During his White House tenure, Donald Trump appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices — all of whom voted for the overturning of Roe v Wade, which guaranteed abortion access.   This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  Harris said in a statement.  This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care.   On Thursday, Williams told the crowd that she wanted them to know  Amber was not a statistic.    She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would ve done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed,  she added.  Describing herself as  broken,  Williams told the audience that she experienced  the worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent, could ever feel.   ProPublica had previously reported that as Thurman lay in her hospital bed, urgently awaiting treatment, her blood pressure sank, and organs began to fail. When doctors finally performed the operation, some 20 hours after she d arrived at the hospital, Thurman pleaded to her mother:  Promise me you ll take care of my son.   Williams had no idea that her daughter had been pregnant, the publication said.  The Independent has contacted Georgia Maternal Mortality in the Georgia Department of Public Health and Piedmont Henry Hospital for comment.  Since 1986, The Independent has campaigned for what we believe in, not what we are told to believe, with integrity, inclusion, innovation and independence as our guiding principles."

2,11,,Two Georgia Deaths Are Tied to Abortion Restrictions. Experts Say Abortion Pills They Took Are Safe,The deaths of two women in Georgia have been tied to a state law that bans most abortions after roughly six weeks ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/two-georgia-deaths-are-tied-to-abortion-restrictions-experts-say-abortion-pills-they-took-are-safe/ar-AA1qQQWR?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak about abortion Friday in Georgia, where two women s deaths have been tied to a state law that mostly bans the procedure after roughly six weeks.  Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat complications that occurred after she took abortion pills. Reported by ProPublica earlier this week, the case is the first publicly reported instance of a woman dying from delayed care tied to a state abortion law.  The news organization also reported on the death of Candi Miller, a woman with lupus, diabetes and hypertension who took abortion pills she ordered online. An autopsy found fetal tissue that hadn t been expelled and a lethal combination of painkillers, ProPublica reported. The state s maternal mortality review committee did not believe abortion medication caused her death.  Still, the fact both women used the pills — mifepristone and misoprostol — may raise questions about whether they are safe. Here are some facts.  What safety limits have been imposed?  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 as a safe and effective way to end early pregnancies. The drug, which blocks the hormone progesterone, also primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of another drug typically used along with it, misoprostol. The pills are used in more than six in 10 abortions nationally.  There are rare occasions when mifepristone can cause excessive bleeding that requires emergency care.  Because of that, the FDA initially imposed strict safety limits on who could prescribe and distribute it — only specially certified physicians and only as part of three mandatory in-person appointments with the patient getting the drug. The doctors also had to be capable of performing emergency surgery to stop excess bleeding and an abortion procedure if the drug didn t end the pregnancy.  Over the years, the FDA reaffirmed mifepristone s safety and repeatedly eased restrictions, culminating in a 2021 decision doing away with any in-person requirements and allowing the pill to be sent through the mail.  In 2022, a coalition of anti-abortion groups filed a federal lawsuit against the FDA challenging the agency s long-standing approval of mifepristone. Justices ruled in June that the abortion opponents lacked the legal right to sue and preserved access to the medication.  How often are there serious problems?  Abortion opponents say the more lax restrictions resulted in many more  emergency complications.  But that argument lumps together women experiencing a range of issues with mifepristone — from the drug not working to people who may simply have questions or concerns but don t require medical care.  OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer  major  or  serious  adverse events after taking mifepristone.  A legal brief by a group of medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says:  When used in medication abortion, major adverse events — significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization — occur in less than 0.32% of patients, according to a highly regarded study with more than 50,000 patients.   The definition that scientists generally use for serious adverse events includes blood transfusions, major surgery, hospital admissions and death, said Ushma Upadhyay, one of the authors of that 2015 study.  The prescribing information included in the packaging for mifepristone tablets lists slightly different statistics for what it calls  serious adverse reactions.  It cites ranges for how frequently various complications occur: 0.03% to 0.5% for transfusion; 0.2% for sepsis and 0.04% to 0.6% for hospitalization related to medication abortions. The ranges reflect findings across various relevant studies, experts said.  Why do patients go to the emergency room?  Mifepristone s labeling also lists a complication that most medical groups don t consider a serious or major adverse event: ER visits, which ranged from 2.9% to 4.6%. The current FDA label lists going to the ER as an option if patients experience prolonged heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain or a sustained fever.  But ER visits don t always reflect big problems, doctors told The Associated Press.  Some people may go there after a medication abortion because they want to be checked out or have questions but don t have a doctor, said Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Others, she said,  don t want to go to their primary care provider about their abortion  because of stigma.  A study she co-authored in 2018 found that slightly more than half of patients who visited the ER because of abortions received only observational care. Some, Upadhyay said,  don t receive any treatment.   How effective is the medication?  Mifepristone results in a completed abortion 97.4% of the time, according to U.S. studies cited in the FDA label.  But in 2.6% of cases, a surgical intervention is needed. And 0.7% of the time, the pregnancy continues.  That s compared to a procedural abortion in a clinic, where the chance of the procedure failing to end a pregnancy  is extremely, extremely low,  probably less than 0.1%, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, a board member for the college of OB-GYNs.   Any time a procedural abortion is done, the clinicians ensure that it was a complete abortion  by examining the tissue that is removed or performing an ultrasound during or after the procedure, she said.  Gupta, who has done abortion procedures for more than 20 years, said there are  very few complications from abortion — any kind of abortion, medication or procedural abortion.  A recent study suggests that s just as true for medication abortions that happen in a clinic, a doctor s office or at home with the help of telehealth.  How does mifepristone s safety and effectiveness compare to other drugs?  The FDA makes drug approval decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing effectiveness, safety and other factors.  No drug is 100% effective, and many common medications don t work for a significant portion of patients.  Antidepressants typically help between 40% and 60% of people with depression. New antibiotics approved by the FDA often resolve about 70% of infections.  Since 2000, roughly 6 million patients have taken mifepristone, according to the FDA. A 2021 review of agency records looking for deaths that were likely related to the drug identified 13, or .00027% of patients.  Medical organizations supporting mifepristone s availability say the drug s safety — given the rate of deaths — compares to  ibuprofen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day.   ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Science and Educational Media Group.

Both experienced complications after taking abortion medications, the reporting said — complications, doctors emphasized, that are exceedingly rare and entirely treatable.   To read about a mom just trying to make the best decisions for herself and her family die from something completely preventable in the United States – I don t think  tragedy  is a strong enough word,  said Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, an obstetrician/gynecologist and founder of Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas.  According to the report, Thurman received abortion medication from a clinic in North Carolina shortly after abortion was banned after six weeks in her home state of Georgia, and she went to her local hospital with a severe infection days later, after her body didn t expel all of the fetal tissue.   There should not have been a second of waiting  for her to receive care, Moayedi told CNN.  She should have immediately been taken for a uterine aspiration,  a procedure that removes the contents of the uterus, performed for both abortion and miscarriage care.  Instead, ProPublica reported, Thurman didn t receive surgical care to remove the fetal tissue for 20 hours. The report said it s not clear from Thurman s records why doctors waited so long, but noted the procedure had been criminalized just weeks before by the state s abortion ban, after the US Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade that summer. Thurman s heart stopped during surgery, the outlet reported, after she d been diagnosed at the hospital with acute severe sepsis and went into organ failure.  According to a second report, Miller didn t seek care at a hospital at all, even — as her son told ProPublica — she was bedridden with pain for days after taking medication abortion pills. A report from the Clayton County medical examiner, obtained by CNN, cited a conversation with her husband in which he indicated that she  did not go to an ob/gyn due to the current legislations on pregnancies and abortions.   Miller too hadn t expelled all the fetal tissue, ProPublica reported, and she should have had a dilation and curettage, or D&C, procedure to remove it and avoid infection. Her autopsy report, obtained by CNN, showed that she died from a combination of medications, including the painkillers fentanyl and acetaminophen; the medical examiner s report noted that she didn t have a history of illicit drug use.  Georgia s Department of Public Health told CNN that the reports of its maternal mortality review committee are confidential. ProPublica, which cited unnamed sources, including members of the committee, noted that those reports deemed Thurman and Miller s deaths  preventable  and, in Miller s case, tied to the state s abortion law.  The reports have enflamed the political debate over access to abortion, with Vice President Kamala Harris saying this week that  this is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.  Harris will visit Georgia on Friday to deliver further remarks on women s reproductive rights.  Abortion rights opponents blamed Thurman s doctors for not providing immediate care – and blamed medication abortion itself.  But researchers who study medication abortion and doctors who prescribe it emphasized to CNN that the regimen is safe and offered guidance for what patients should do if they experience rare complications.  How does medication abortion work?  Medication abortion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2000 and is currently cleared to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks of gestation.  Data shows that it s now the most common way people in the US access abortion, making up about two-thirds of the approximately 1 million abortions in the formal health-care system in the US last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.  It consists of two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue, and is taken first. It s followed a day or two later by misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract, leading to cramping and bleeding, during which the pregnancy tissue is expelled.  The process, Moayedi explained, is  physiologically really the same  as a miscarriage.  How common are complications?  Serious adverse events with medication abortion happen less than 0.5% of the time, according to Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) program at the University of California, San Francisco. Those adverse events can include hospitalization, blood transfusions and surgery, he said.  Retaining pregnancy tissue and requiring vacuum aspiration happens for 3% to 5% of people who have a medication abortion, Grossman noted, but it s not considered a serious complication and is typically managed in an outpatient setting; Moayedi said retained pregnancy tissue rarely leads to infection.  Deaths after medication abortion are very rare too, Grossman noted: There were 32 reported among people using mifepristone between 2000 and 2022, a time when approximately 5.9 million women used the medicine. He said his team reviewed the causes reported to the FDA, and almost half were probably not related to the abortion.   I have cared for thousands upon thousands of people with medication abortion,  said Moayedi, whose clinic provides  wraparound  care, seeing people before or after abortion in Texas, where abortions are illegal with rare exceptions.  I can count on my one hand — less than one hand — the number that have had an infection afterwards. So this is exceedingly rare.   Rare particularly, Moayedi said, because women  could immediately seek help  if they experienced a problem — something she worries, as the ProPublica reporting suggests, may be less accessible in states with abortion bans.  What should patients do if they experience complications?  Signs of complications include fever, severe abdominal pain and bleeding that soaks through more than two menstrual pads an hour for two hours, Moayedi said. Grossman added that feeling very weak or having nausea, vomiting or diarrhea more than a day after taking the last pill can also be a sign of an infection.  He advises people experiencing any worrisome symptoms to try to reach the clinic or service that provided the medications, or to call the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline at 1-833-246-2632; it s a free hotline staffed by clinicians to answer questions and provide support.   But if a patient is experiencing one of the symptoms mentioned above and they cannot talk with a clinician by phone,  Grossman said,  they should go to an emergency department.   What about patients in states with abortion bans?  People experiencing these complications can — and should — legally receive care for them anywhere, even in states that have abortion bans, doctors told CNN, so they shouldn t hesitate to go to a hospital for emergency care.  But the onus can t be only on the patient to ensure that they get care, Moayedi emphasized; hospital systems need to ensure that they understand the laws and have plans in place that enable physicians to provide necessary treatment, she said.  Grossman also pointed out that  the same complications that occur with medication abortion can also occur with miscarriage, and the treatment is the same.    I would never advise a patient to lie, but I am very concerned about these reports that patients  care is being delayed in states with abortion bans when they present with complications after an abortion — even though the law should not apply to these cases,  he said, noting that his team has heard through its research about similar delays in care for other patients.  The doctors can treat the patient presenting with bleeding or an infection without knowing whether the patient took medications or not.   He said he advises clinicians not to ask patients whether they took medications to end their pregnancies,  since it doesn t affect their care, and instead may just increase legal risks for the patients.

2,13,,"Trump says if he wins, women would 'no longer be thinking about abortion'","Donald Trump has returned to North Carolina to stump in the battleground state, which Democrats and Republicans are treating ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-says-if-he-wins-women-would-no-longer-be-thinking-about-abortion/ar-AA1qYb4f?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Former President Trump returned to North Carolina on Saturday, stumping in the Southern battleground state with direct appeals to women, claiming he would be a better champion for them than Vice President Kamala Harris, who is vying to become the first female president.  Trump campaigned in Wilmington, along the state s southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president s top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about Robinson s alleged posts on a pornography website s message board. Trump did not mention Robinson during a speech that lasted just over an hour.  Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn t be forced out of the race by  salacious tabloid lies.  Trump s campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump  is focused on winning the White House and saving this country  and calling North Carolina  a vital part of that plan,  without mentioning Robinson.  Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Harris  campaign highlighting the Republican candidates  ties and Robinson s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris  campaign, it s their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a downballot race.  Both abortion rights and Robinson are electoral liabilities for Trump in a state he previously won twice. Before CNN s report, Robinson already was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state s attorney general. Polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close race here and nationally.  Trump downplays abortion as a campaign issue  In his first outdoor rally since the second apparent attempt to assassinate him, Trump argued women would be safer and more prosperous with him as president and would  no longer be thinking about abortion.    I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure,  Trump said.  Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again. So women, we love you. We re going to take care of you.   The former president said women won t have to think about abortion because decisions about regulating it are now left to the states. Many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in 2022. Trump nominated three of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe.  North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks last year, with Republicans in the state legislature overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper s veto.  Voters overwhelmingly say they trust Harris to do a better job handling abortion policy, with 55% favoring her while 27% favored Trump in a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.  Harris and Democrats running down the ballot have highlighted stories of women who faced severe medical complications or death because they didn t get proper medical care from doctors worried about the impact of abortion laws. Harris on Friday blasted Trump as a threat to women s freedoms and their lives, warning in a speech in Georgia that Republicans would continue to target access to abortion if he returns to the White House.   Trump is scared out of his mind that women will vote like our freedoms and our lives are on the line this November — and he should be, because that s exactly what we will do,  Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement after Trump s rally.  Trump also showed a gentler side, inviting two of his young grandchildren onstage. The former president lifted Carolina Trump to the microphone, where she said  Make America great again  to cheers, followed by her older brother, Luke Trump, who said,  Vote for Grandpa.  They re the children of Eric Trump, the former president s second son, and his wife, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who now serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.  Bulletproof glass surrounded Trump as he spoke, a new precaution for outdoor venues the Secret Service implemented after a bullet grazed Trump s ear during a rally in Butler, Pa.  Trump supporters dismiss the new claims against Robinson  A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns, but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That s part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall.  With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina s marquee downballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as  Martin Luther King on steroids.   Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued:  I think you re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.   Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion  weren t responsible enough to keep your skirt down  and comparing abortion to slavery.  Charlie Kimball, a 46-year-old former construction worker from Burgaw, who said he is currently on disability, dismissed the new allegations against Robinson as  fake news.    That s his personal life. Who cares?  Kimball said.  It s all hearsay.   Although the presidential contenders have made more visits to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state s importance. Following Biden s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris.  Wilmington is in New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state.  Julia Novotny, 55, of Wilmington, said she s come around to supporting Trump after initial reservations because of allegations that he s been sexually abusive to women, which he denies.   He s classy, he s a gentleman, he looks good in a suit, and he has strong values,  Novotny said.  Everybody makes mistakes, and whether he did or didn t, I don t know, but you know what? Leave him alone. He s a good man. He wants to change this country.   Kinnard and Verduzco write for the Associated Press. AP writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report."
2,14,,Democrats Are the Real Abortion Radicals | Opinion,Why is so much of the media covering for the extreme abortion positions of Harris and most of the Democratic Party?,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-are-the-real-abortion-radicals-opinion/ar-AA1qQqP7?ocid=BingNewsVerp," The majority of Americans believe in a woman s right to make decisions about her own body,  Vice President Kamala Harris stated emphatically on the debate stage in Philadelphia.  Harris was not lying when she made that point, but what she was concealing—and what many in the media have been concealing, too—is the consensus that s grown within the American public about not just a woman s right to an abortion, but about limits on how long that right should extend into a pregnancy.  A look back at Gallup s polling in 2022 on the issue reveals that a record-high 69 percent of Americans support the right, and there were endless headlines reporting that news. But there was no media fanfare about Gallup s polling on limits to a woman s right to an abortion, and we know the reason why: the outcome was inconvenient. It turns out that after 14 weeks of pregnancy, Americans  support for abortion plunged in the Gallup polling. By 24 weeks—six months into a pregnancy term—the bottom fell out, with nearly two-thirds of Americans against. Two-thirds.  Gallup reported in its 2022 summary that Americans are twice as likely to say abortions at 24 weeks should be illegal—a true American consensus that Harris, the Democratic Party, and most of the mainstream media ignored.  Dig a bit deeper, and the abortion polling gets even more interesting. Gallup data made clear that there are more extremists on the pro-choice side of the aisle: a stunning 19 percent believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while a mere 8 percent believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. And surprise, surprise, that cold hard fact got no media play either.  And so the question remains: why is so much of the media covering for the extreme abortion positions of Harris and most of the Democratic Party—while having no problem reporting the supposedly more extreme position of their political rivals?  It is not just the polling consensus on abortion from the American people that has gone underreported; it s Harris  real-life abortion voting record as a U.S. senator from California—and that of the Democratic Party as a whole.  Let s review that voting history—and by all means, click the embedded links to see the congressional voting rolls for yourself.  During her time as U.S. senator, as former U.S. consul to Bermuda Lee Rizzuto explained in a Daily Caller column, Harris voted not once but twice against S.311 (the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act). The bill would have prohibited health care practitioners, to quote the legislative language,  from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.  In 2019, 53 senators voted for the bill, including three Democrats (Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia), and 44 voted against—none of the Republicans—leaving the bill short of the 60 Senate votes needed to make it law.  Harris also voted in February of 2020 against S. 3275 (the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act) which would have banned late-term abortions after five months of pregnancy—the point at which unborn children can feel pain. The vote tally was again 53 yeas (including only two Democrats) and 44 nays.  In addition, Harris  party nearly unanimously backed the radical Women s Health Protection Act, a bill that reads like a manifesto for unlimited and unrestricted abortion rights through all nine months of the pregnancy.  The bill, which both House and Senate Democrats have tried to pass, permits late-term abortion procedures on nearly fully formed children.  This inhumane bill has become the Democrat Party s standard,  Rizzuto writes.  It garnered a whopping 99% support from House Democrats in both 2021 and 2022, passing the House by 218-211 and 219-210 respectively, with only one Democrat voting against it both years.   But things get even worse when you see how the Democrats, their allies, and the media spin these matters. Consider the Guttmacher Institute, a leading voice on the abortion activist front. A look at their national map of state abortion policies reveals just how out of step they are with the American public when it comes to abortion limits.  The map is color coded, with each color representing differing categories, from most restrictive to most protective. What s most interesting is what the institution considers  restrictive.  Click on the  restrictive  state of Pennsylvania, and you ll discover that abortion is legally permissible up to 24 weeks (the sixth month of pregnancy), a limit the vast majority of Americans would not describe as  restrictive.  Click the  restrictive  state of Wisconsin, and you ll find that abortion in the state is legal up to 22 weeks. Kansas, another  restrictive  state, is 22 weeks, too. Click Virginia—another  restrictive  state—and you ll discover abortions are legal until the end of the second trimester. Wyoming, another  restrictive  state, is 24 to 26 weeks. That s up to two weeks into the sixth month of pregnancy.  Maybe abortion activists should have a conversation with the voters in those so-called  restrictive  states—and the vast majority of Americans who agree with them when it comes to limits to abortion rights—and recalibrate their definitions.  It s also time for the GOP to have a conversation with the American people about abortion extremism in the Democratic Party, and how Kamala Harris, nonprofit activist groups, and their allies in the mainstream media are out of step with the vast majority of Americans when it comes to limits on abortion.  Rizzuto is one of the few GOP leaders to take a public and pragmatic stand on abortion, pointing a way forward for the party to best communicate the extreme nature of its opponents.  Abortion laws should be left up to each individual state. Late-term abortions should not be permitted,  Rizzuto explains.  If the American public understood that these two sentences encapsulate the policies of the GOP and how horrific the policies of the Democrats are, they would support the GOP on this issue.   Voters will decide in November where they stand on this issue. Without strong GOP messaging on the extreme positions of the Democratic Party as it relates to abortion limits—and just how far from mainstream American opinion Harris and the Democratic Party actually are—it may just cost the GOP the election.

Trump, in the lengthy late-night missive to his Truth Social in all capitalized letters, said  women are poorer than they were four years ago, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are more depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago.   TRUMP VOWS HE  WILL NOT BLOCK  ABORTION PILLS OR MEDICATION IF ELECTED, SAYS HE BELIEVES IN  EXCEPTIONS    I will fix all of that, and fast, and at long last this national nightmare will be over,  he said.  Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free!   Polls have consistently shown Trump running strongly, against Vice President Kamala Harris in most demographic groups, but struggling with women. Much of that has been attributed to the fact that the three justices he picked for the Supreme Court helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had enshrined abortion protections under federal law.  In his post, Trump wrote that women  will no longer be thinking about abortion, because it is now where it always had to be, with the states, and a vote of the people—and with powerful exceptions, like those that Ronald Reagan insisted on for rape, incest, and the life of the mother—but not allowing for Democrat demanded late term abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, or even execution of a baby after birth.   READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP   I will protect women at a level never seen before,  he said.  They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure.   Trump added:  Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and great again!   The former president s play for the female vote comes after Vice President Harris campaigned in Georgia, delivering a speech about the consequences of, what her campaign calls  extreme Trump Abortion Bans.    After Vice President Harris spent the week speaking about the consequences of Trump Abortion Bans and the stakes of this election for women s lives, Donald Trump snapped — taking to his phone late at night to rant and rave about women,  Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in response to Trump s Truth Social post.  After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he s trying to tell us how to think.   Chitika said  Trump thinks he can control women — he s wrong.   The Harris campaign said he is  terrified that women across the country will vote like our lives and freedoms depend on it, because they do.    Women aren t stupid. We see Trump s Project 2025 agenda for what it is: an extreme plan to ban abortion nationwide and threaten access to IVF and birth control,  Chitika said.  We ll vote like it this November.   JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK  But Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital that Harris and President Joe Biden have put women s lives in danger, and noted the names of women who have been killed by illegal immigrants.   President Trump is right. Kamala may want to be the first woman president, but she s made the lives of women worse — more dangerous and more unaffordable,  Leavitt said.  If Kamala cared about protecting women, she would close the border and stop allowing rapists and murderers to flow into our country to prey on young women and girls. Kamala has never said the names of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nunguaray, and Rachel Morin. President Trump has honored their lives and consoled their grieving families.   Leavitt added:  If women want safety, security and prosperity for our families, there s only one option on the ballot — President Trump.   As for Project 2025, a blueprint for a Republican administration crafted by the Heritage Foundation, Leavitt repeated Trump s assertion that he did not commission it and has no plans to implement it if elected.   President Trump has repeatedly said he has nothing to do with Project 2025,  Leavitt said, adding that  Kamala s campaign is lying because they are losing.   Harris continues to claim that Trump will install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions, despite Trump repeatedly saying that he would never support a national abortion ban, and believes in exceptions for abortion, including rape, incest, and life of the mother.  Harris has refused to say whether she supports any abortion restrictions up to birth.  Trump has vowed that he  will not block  abortion pills or abortion medication for women, should he be elected president."
2,16,,Are Republicans still talking about abortion?,"As Kamala Harris gives an abortion speech in Georgia, 538 looked at how anti-abortion Republicans performed in primaries this ...",https://abcnews.go.com/538/republicans-talking-abortion/story?id=113884930,"For decades, Republicans had a unified message on abortion: The party was  pro-life,  and they leaned into the issue of abortion to turn out their base, who largely agreed. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the message that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. Sure enough, Trump s conservative appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court helped deliver on that promise in the landmark 2022 decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization.  That decision, though, also upended abortion politics in America in a way that turned the tables on Republicans. Since then, expanding and protecting abortion rights has largely been a winning issue for Democrats at the ballot box, while Republicans have struggled to find a cohesive message. This year, the party has been somewhat split as it balances continued calls from conservatives to press for some form of national abortion ban with the reality that abortion restrictions are becoming increasingly unpopular in the post-Dobbs landscape. Despite appointing the justices who overturned Roe and previously saying he d support a national abortion ban, Trump has waffled on the issue heading into the general election, and the party appears to be following his lead, at least when it comes to its official party line: For the first time in four decades, the Republican National Committee left language supporting a national ban on abortion out of its platform this cycle.  We saw this split play out in this cycle s Republican primaries as well. While candidates  exact stances on abortion are sometimes hard to pinpoint, we read the campaign websites of every candidate who ran in the 2024 Republican primaries for U.S. House, U.S. Senate or governor to see what they said, or didn t say, about abortion, and whether they won their contests. Out of around 1100 total GOP primary candidates, we found 377 whose home page, biography or issue page(s) used at least one of the following phrases:  pro-life,   sanctity of life,   right to life,   no abortion,   against abortion  or  unborn,  and did not say abortion is an issue of states  rights (as of the date of their respective primary contests). Meanwhile, far more Republicans running in these primaries, 501, didn t mention the issue of abortion at all.  As for which candidates ran on an anti-abortion platform, a closer look at the types of races they ran in and won can tell us more about the party s evolving stance on the issue:  Overall, nearly three-quarters (152 of 209) of the races we tracked in seats rated solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report included at least one candidate with an explicitly anti-abortion platform, and 134 were won by one of those candidates. That means nearly two-thirds of races in solid red districts will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this November who s almost certain to win election.  Anti-abortion candidates also ran in, and often won, Republican primaries in the handful of competitive races that are rated as likely or lean Republican, though they were less dominant here. Just over half of these races (11 of 19) had at least one candidate with an anti-abortion platform, while fewer than half (eight of 19) will have an anti-abortion nominee on the general election ballot.  Meanwhile, many Republican candidates in swing states and in House districts ranked as toss-ups chose to downplay abortion as an issue. Our analysis found explicitly anti-abortion candidates in 11 of the 28 districts ranked as toss-ups, but only five anti-abortion primary winners: Bernie Moreno in Ohio s Senate race, Laurie Buckhout in North Carolina s 1st District, Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania s 7th, Don Bacon in Nebraska s 2nd and Juan Ciscomani in Arizona s 6th. Most of the winners in these races, 16 of 28, actually avoided mentioning abortion on their campaign websites completely. Some of these candidates, however, like Alaska U.S. House candidate Nick Begich, have made support for policies like a national abortion ban clear in other venues — another strategy for trying to de-emphasize the issue in their official messaging while still staking out a conservative stance.  And finally, Republicans running in Democratic territory were much less likely to run on anti-abortion platforms: Half of the 36 GOP primaries in races that lean or are likely Democratic featured anti-abortion nominees, but only four of those races (11 percent) will see an anti-abortion Republican nominee on the ballot this fall. The numbers are similar in solidly Democratic races, in which 15 percent will have an anti-abortion Republican nominee. As in toss-up districts, more than half of Republican nominees in these races didn t mention abortion on their websites during their primary campaigns.  ***  All of this reflects a careful balance that Republican politicians these days have to strike between appealing to their party base in primaries and pressures to moderate when facing competitive general elections.  Public opinion is much closer to the Democratic Party s stance on the issue, as abortion restrictions remain unpopular even in red states. Polling from the Public Religion Research Institute last year found only five states — Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah — where the majority of voters did not support abortion being legal in all or most cases. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in most cases, while 34 percent said abortion should be illegal in most cases.  But while public opinion has moved left on the issue over time, Republican opinion has remained relatively stagnant, widening the gap between the Republican and general electorate. This is especially true of white evangelical Christians, an important part of the Republican base in the Trump era. Seventy-three percent of this group supports banning abortion in all or most cases, according to a Pew Research Center poll earlier this year — far more than other religious groups (33 percent of other protestants) and Republican or Republican-leaning voters as a whole (57 percent).  Plus, primary contests specifically tend to attract the most committed partisans, giving GOP politicians ample reason to  run to the right  to win their party s nominations — even if those same candidates may de-emphasize abortion as an issue in their general election bids.  The people who turn out in the primaries are the ones who have the strongest belief, and for Republicans, that often means the people who are the most strongly anti-abortion,  said Anne Whitesell, a political scientist at Miami University in Ohio who studies politics and gender, and has researched anti-abortion activists post-Dobbs.  For example, all three non-incumbent candidates who won GOP nominations in toss-up races and included anti-abortion language on their websites (Moreno, Buckhout and Mackenzie) ran in primaries against at least one other anti-abortion candidate. And two of them, Buckhout and Mackenzie, have since removed anti-abortion language from their campaign websites as they prepare for tight general election contests against Democratic incumbents.  In recent election cycles, Democrats nationwide have relied on abortion to turn out their base while also winning independents, tying Republicans to unpopular abortion stances. Abortion has also become much more salient with voters, especially for those that lean toward Democrats or identify as pro-choice. Thirty-two percent of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shared their views on the issue in a Gallup poll from May, up from 24 percent in 2020 — a difference that was largely driven by pro-choice voters, 40 percent of whom said that was true. Plus, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling connected to its anti-abortion law that threatened access to in vitro fertilization treatments has further complicated the picture, opening a new line of attack for Democrats when it comes to reproductive rights.  But Republicans, especially Trump, have also tried to flip the script on abortion and paint Democrats as extremists by making false claims about late-term abortions and claiming that Democratic policies would allow for killing babies after birth. Others, like Trump s presidential primary opponent Nikki Haley, have urged a less combative approach and acknowledged  diverse opinions  within the party. It makes sense, given that many Republican women in particular support protecting access to abortion in some circumstances, according to polling from KFF. Still, the anti-abortion forces within the party aren t going anywhere soon, and more moderate Republicans aren t necessarily going to ditch their party over the issue.  On the whole, are they going to vote for a Democrat instead of the Republican? Probably not,  Whitesell said.  Still, voters trust Democrats and Harris more on abortion by a wide margin, and women voters continue to say it s an important issue for them. Abortion could help tip the balance in some of November s key races, and we ll be watching to see how anti-abortion Republicans pivot from their primary messages, or whether an updated message could help the party make gains on what seems to be a losing issue for them.

2,18,,Abortion Ban Ruling Challenged as ND Seeks Stay Pending Appeal,The Red River Women's Clinic—an abortion clinic that used to be the only one in North Dakota before it moved from Fargo to ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/abortion-ban-ruling-challenged-as-nd-seeks-stay-pending-appeal/ar-AA1qRmA5?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"North Dakota asked a state district judge on Wednesday to temporarily halt his recent ruling against the state s abortion ban.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court s Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization ruling in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade, which removed federal protections for abortion and left it up to the states to decide, over two dozen states created some type of abortion ban, including North Dakota.  Under North Dakota s 2023 ban, abortion is a felony except when the procedure is done to prevent a pregnant patient s death or a  serious health risk.  In cases of rape or incest, abortion is allowed up to six weeks, which is before many people know they are pregnant, according to Planned Parenthood.  The Red River Women s Clinic—an abortion clinic that used to be the only one in North Dakota before it moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, soon after Roe v. Wade was overturned—and several doctors have challenged North Dakota s abortion ban as unconstitutionally vague for physicians and its health exception as too narrow.  North Dakota asked Judge Bruce Romanick in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, to throw out the lawsuit and the plaintiffs asked him to let the trial proceed. Romanick decided to cancel the trial and later found the abortion ban unconstitutional, but has not issued a final judgment yet.  Last week, Romanick ruled that the abortion ban  is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,  and that pregnant patients in North Dakota have a fundamental right to abortion before the fetus is viable under the state constitution.   The Court is left to craft findings and conclusions on an issue of vital public importance when the longstanding precedent on that issue no longer exists federally, and much of the North Dakota precedent on that issue relied on the federal precedent now upended — with relatively no idea how the appellate court in this state will address the issue,  Romanick wrote in his ruling.  The state then asked for a stay in the case, pending an appeal of his ruling to the state Supreme Court in a filing on Wednesday.   A stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues,  state attorneys said.  Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said on Tuesday that the plaintiffs would oppose any stay in the case.   Look, they don t have to appeal, and they also don t have to seek a stay because, like I said, this decision is not leading any time soon to clinics reopening across the state,  he said.  Hearron continued:  We re talking about standard-of-care, necessary, time-sensitive health care, abortion care generally provided in hospitals or by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and for the state to seek a stay or to appeal a ruling that allows those physicians just to practice medicine I think is shameful.   Meanwhile, Republican state Senator Janne Myrdal, who introduced North Dakota s abortion ban, said she s confident the state s Supreme Court will overturn Romanick s ruling and called his decision one of the poorest legal decisions she has read.   I challenge anybody to go through his opinion and find anything but  personal opinions,   she said on Monday.  This article includes reporting from The Associated Press."
2,19,,Republicans are trying a new approach to abortion in the race for Congress,"In the most contested races for control of the U.S. House, many Republican candidates are speaking up about women’s rights to ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-are-trying-a-new-approach-to-abortion-in-the-race-for-congress/ar-AA1qQYRi?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the most contested races for control of the U.S. House, many Republican candidates are speaking up about women s rights to abortion access and reproductive care in new and surprising ways, a deliberate shift for a GOP blindsided by some political ramifications of the post-Roe v. Wade era.  Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care.  In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said,  There can be no place for extremism in women s health care.   In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows,  I have always supported women s access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.   And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says,  I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.   It s a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women s lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions.  The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans  campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP s failure to grasp the political power of women s reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters.   The Republicans have always known they re actually on the wrong side of this issue,  said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party s shift  wouldn t surprise me.   With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women s access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades.  On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it s best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He s also distanced himself from the far right s longtime goal of a national abortion ban.  With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party s ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president s ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer:  We are not going back.   The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration.  Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years.  Voters didn t always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement s push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November s promised  red wave  of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority.  By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That s an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision.  In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares:  I m pro-choice.   Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars  lying about Republican candidates  positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.    Republicans can t let Democrats lie any longer — they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.   Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views — past and present.   Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,  said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats.  House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars  worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races.  Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris  example.  Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed,  We ll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.   Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions.  Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — a historic accomplishment — during the former president s term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority.  First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans.  One of the nation s leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide.  But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue.  Voters have a right to know where I stand,  Lawler said.  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report."
3,20,,"With immigration and abortion on Arizona’s ballot, Republicans are betting on momentum",Arizona voters will decide whether illegal border crossings should be a state crime. Republican lawmakers put the measure on ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/with-immigration-and-abortion-on-arizonas-ballot-republicans-are-betting-on-momentum/ar-AA1qW6G8?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"PHOENIX (AP) — Voters will decide ballot measures on abortion and immigration in Arizona, a key battleground state where Republicans are looking to capitalize on concerns about illegal border crossings to counter an expected increase in turnout by people determined to restore and protect abortion rights.  And while the abortion initiative is bolstered by a citizen-led campaign flush with cash, the GOP lawmakers who added a measure to empower state law enforcers to crack down on people who are in Arizona illegally say it already has so much momentum that they don t plan to raise money or spend much time selling it.  Abortion has many people fired up since an 1864 law banning nearly all abortions was revived and then quickly repealed this year. But immigration consistently ranks as a top concern in this western swing state, where anti-immigration legislation has long fueled national debates over illegal crossings from Mexico.   Voters will approve this more to send a message that something, anything, needs to be done,  said Barrett Marson, a Phoenix-based Republican strategist.  It lacks financial backing because people know it s going to pass and that it has little impact on curbing illegal immigration into Arizona.   Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma voted with fellow Republicans in June to put the measure on the ballot. He called it common sense and just a small part of  what actually needs to happen to secure the border.   Frustration over illegal immigration persists despite moves by the Biden-Harris administration this year to shut down what had been an unprecedented surge in new arrivals. Democrats blame former President Donald Trump for making it a top campaign issue by persuading allies in Congress to torpedo bipartisan legislation that could have bolstered the federal response.  Republican lawmakers across the country this year have pushed tougher immigration policies, with their majorities in Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma passing laws to conduct immigration enforcement at the state level. But in each of those states, federal courts blocked their efforts to enforce the laws.  Democratic strategist DJ Quinlan said that despite universal concerns about the border, plenty of voters and stakeholders oppose this particular measure, which would make it a state crime for noncitizens to illegally cross from Mexico into Arizona outside authorized ports of entry. The crime would enable local police to arrest violators and state judges to order deportations, which are roles historically left to the federal government.   When you talk to a lot of people in law enforcement or in the business community or that deal with these sorts of issues on a day-to-day basis, this referendum is not the answer,  Quinlan said.  The measure also would require state agencies that administer federal, state or local benefit programs to use a federal database to verify that no ineligible noncitizens get the benefits. And it would shield law enforcement from civil lawsuits alleging racial profiling of Latinos or other minorities.  Some of its provisions aren t directly related to illegal immigration, including making selling fentanyl that leads to a person s death a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Latino groups argued this violates a state constitutional requirement that legislative proposals cover a single subject. The Arizona Supreme Court disagreed, clearing to a path for voters to decide.  Kent Jenson, a 68-year-old retiree, said he opposes illegal immigration and detests drug use, so he plans to vote for the immigration measure and against the abortion initiative.  It s terrible what fentanyl has done to families,  Jenson said.  Opponents argue the immigration legislation would harm Arizona s reputation and economy even more than a so-called  show me your papers  law approved by lawmakers in 2010 that was partially stuck down by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later.  The cost also worries some mayors, county officials and law enforcement leaders who warn that diverting resources to border security could deprive their day-to-day operations and essential public services.  An Associated Press review of state campaign finance records found no contributions specifically supporting Proposition 314, nor any donations explicitly against it.  Toma said Republicans are spending their time, money and energy on competitive races and other statewide ballot measures, with 13 in all. At stake is not only control of the U.S. Senate and White House, but also the state Legislature. Republicans have a one-seat majority in each chamber and Democrats hope to regain power for the first time in decades.   People are going to focus, and rightly so, on the issues that actually need help,  Toma said.  Citizen-led Proposition 139, which would enshrine abortion access in the state s constitution, has generated millions of dollars in donations and reached the ballot with more than a half-million signatures. Arizona is one of 10 states where voters will consider abortion protections.   It is a basic human right that all women need to have autonomy over their own bodies,  said Erin Dean, 34, a voter who used to be registered as a Republican but now backs Democrats.  The political action committee Arizona for Abortion Access raised nearly $23 million as of late July, campaign finance records show. A PAC opposing the measure, It Goes Too Far, had raised nearly $900,000.  Republican and Democratic strategists alike say the abortion measure could draw voters who might not otherwise be interested in casting a ballot.  Marson, the GOP strategist, expects it to boost turnout with young and first-time voters. The same can t be said for the immigration measure, which he predicts will pass anyway.   Not many teenagers are itching to vote on an illegal immigration issue even if a wide swath of people support the measure,  Marson said.  Ballot measures on immigration have been popular in Arizona before.  In 2004, voters made Arizona the only state to require proof of citizenship status to register to vote. A measure banning in-state tuition for noncitizens was passed in 2006, but key parts were overturned in 2022 when Arizonans voted to make students — regardless of immigration status — eligible for state financial aid. ___"

3,22,,"On Abortion, Kamala Harris Is the Extremist","At one point during the Sept. 10 presidential debate, former President Donald Trump accused Democrats of not only supporting ...",https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/09/20/on_abortion_kamala_harris_is_the_extremist_151658.html,"At one point during the Sept. 10 presidential debate, former President Donald Trump accused Democrats of not only supporting unlimited third-trimester abortions but the  execution  of babies after birth.  Once Trump wrapped up his rant, Linsey Davis, one of the ABC News moderators,  fact-checked  the former president, helpfully noting that  there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it s born.   If Trump had been better prepared, he could have pointed out that a senator named Kamala Harris, while running for president in 2020, opposed legislation that would have compelled doctors to provide infants who survive abortions the basic care they would any other human being in distress. So, not exactly  executing  babies. Just negligent homicide.  And ironically, it s because the contemporary left s position on abortion is so morally unfathomable that the media can gaslight voters.  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, after all, simply required medical professionals to  exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.  Yet Harris and 40 other Democratic senators opposed it.  Most Democrats, however, argued the bill was superfluous because this sort of thing never ever happens -- just like the late-term abortions of viable babies never happens. Tragically, this is untrue.  Just ask Tim Walz, Harris  running mate. The Minnesota governor might not believe free speech is an absolute right, but he has no problem making abortion one. Indeed, Walz overturned laws prohibiting coercing of women into abortions. He defunded pregnancy centers. He removed requirements for informed consent on abortion -- or any consent, for that matter. And then he stripped any protections for babies who survived abortion attempts. Five babies were left to die in 2021.  Notwithstanding Harris  contrived laugh mocking the very notion she supports unfettered government-funded abortion from conception to delivery, as it stands, seven states, as well as Washington, D.C., have no gestational limits on the procedure. One allows abortions in the third trimester. Sixteen allow abortions after viability.  Indeed, during the debate, Trump was compelled to do the job of the ABC News moderators when he asked Harris to name a single restriction she supported. The vice president s word salad offered none. Harris, instead, claimed she wanted to codify the  protections  of Roe.  Let s remember two things about this misleading talking point.  First, by the time Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization was decided, Roe had no enforceable protections. Zero. When the Atlantic interviewed the Colorado butcher Warren Hern last year, he d already spent 50 years terminating the lives of completely viable babies in the third trimester. He did it under Roe v. Wade.  Hern also admitted most of his victims were physically healthy. Which is unsurprising. Not long ago, the Charlotte Lozier Institute found that most medical literature showed late-term abortions weren t sought because of  maternal health complications or lethal fetal anomalies discovered late in pregnancy  despite what we are incessantly told by activists. A pro-choice Guttmacher Institute study similarly found that most late-term abortions were not  for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.  (As far as I can tell, they re no longer conducting inquiries into this inconvenient matter.)  It is difficult -- purposefully so, one imagines -- to calculate how many viable babies are aborted every year. It is probably around 1.3% of the total. Which is to say thousands, perhaps over 8,000, viable babies are killed every year; most, if not all, having nothing to do with  saving the mother s life.  (There s no law anywhere in the country that bars a doctor from protecting the life of the mother.) There are far more healthy babies terminated than school shooting victims every year. And Democrats want to enshrine the practice into law.  Of course, sometimes these decisions are often fraught with complicated ethical questions. No one should diminish this reality. It s not the pro-lifer who treats the issue frivolously.  Two, Democrats want to go way beyond codifying Roe. The Women s Health Protection Act, for instance, would not only have made it impossible to enforce any fetal viability limits, but it would have unconstitutionally overturned hundreds of existing state laws, including ones banning sex-selective abortions, protecting conscientious objectors, upholding parental or guardian notification for minors, and many others.  On abortion, there is only one extremist on the ballot.  COPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM"
3,23,,‘She should be alive today’ — Harris spotlights woman’s death to blast abortion bans and Trump,"For the first time since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris has given a speech ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/harris-focusing-on-personal-stories-as-she-campaigns-on-abortion-rights/ar-AA1qTZfO?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"ATLANTA (AP) — Kamala Harris blasted Donald Trump as a threat to women s freedoms and their very lives, warning in a speech in the battleground state of Georgia on Friday that Republicans would continue to choke off access to abortion if he returns to the White House.  The Democratic vice president s visit came days after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies.  Such deaths, Harris said, were not only preventable but predictable because of laws that have been implemented since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Although Georgia s six-week ban allows abortions in early pregnancy to save a mother s life, critics say the law has created dangerous confusion for doctors about when they re allowed to provide care.   Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die?  Harris asked.  Harris shared the story of Amber Thurman, a mother who decided to have an abortion when she became pregnant again.   She had her future all planned out,  Harris said.  And it was her plan. What she wanted to do for herself, for her son, for their future.   However, Thurman waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills. She developed sepsis and died.   She was loved,  Harris said.  And she should be alive today.   Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court s decision more than two years ago, but Friday s speech was her first focused squarely on the issue since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.  Harris, who was in the Atlanta area on Friday to address the issue, heard Thursday night from the mother and sisters of one of the women who died.  During a livestreamed campaign event hosted by Oprah Winfrey and attended by Harris, Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Thurman, tearfully told viewers that  people around the world need to know that this was preventable.  Williams said she initially did not want to go public about her daughter s 2022 death but ultimately decided it was important for people to understand her daughter  was not a statistic. She was loved.   Harris told the family,  I m just so sorry. The courage you all have shown is extraordinary.   Trump has repeatedly said he was proud to help overturn Roe v. Wade by appointing conservative justices during his term in office. He s also said he supports exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother.  Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump s campaign, said that since Georgia has such exceptions in place,  it s unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect the lives of mothers.   Anti-abortion advocates and doctors argued on Friday that the women s deaths raise questions around the safety of taking abortion pills at home without management by a doctor. Advocates have been pushing for tougher restrictions on the pills for years, most recently at the U.S. Supreme Court in a failed attempt to limit availability.   Women think that it s completely safe for them to go online and order these drugs,  Christina Francis, a Fort Wayne, Indiana, OB-GYN who opposes abortion, told reporters on Friday.  Since 2000, the FDA has approved a two-drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol as a safe way to end pregnancies through 10 weeks gestation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA eliminated an in-person visit requirement to get the drugs. Reported complications have been rare and surgical intervention to end the pregnancy is needed in 2.6% of cases.  Dozens of pregnant patients have faced delayed care or been turned away from hospitals amid medical emergencies over the last two years, a violation of federal law, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Violations occurred in states with and without abortion bans. But an AP analysis earlier this year found an immediate spike in some states with abortion bans, including Texas, following the ruling.  Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN in Georgia, said the six-week ban has caused a  massive environment of fear and confusion and uncertainty  for the medical community.   Medicine is a gray area,  she said. Laws  are a blunt instrument.   She said Republican legislators who are now blaming hospitals and doctors are seeing the ramifications of the laws playing out in real time.   The law is preventing us from being able to provide evidence-based care without having to think about the risk of criminal prosecution,  she said.  In-person early voting began on Friday in three states — Virginia, South Dakota and Minnesota — and Harris  campaign is hoping that reproductive rights will be a strong motivator for Democrats.  About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their votes – but it s more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About 6 in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about 4 in 10 male voters.  The gender gap doesn t stop there.  About 6 in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about 2 in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris.  Democrats point to a series of electoral wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, and advocates believe Harris is a strong messenger. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate she gave a forceful answer on how the bans have affected even women who never intended to end pregnancies.  Harris has a long history on reproductive health issues, especially Black maternal health. Since she took over the top of the ticket, others have toured the nation talking about reproductive rights, including her husband, Doug Emhoff.  ___ Long and Seitz reported from Washington.

Reproductive rights have been one of the driving issues of the Harris  campaign. Her team launched a  reproductive freedom  bus tour in early September with their first stop in Palm Beach County, former President Donald Trump s backyard.

He would not commit during the debate to vetoing a potential federal abortion ban if it came to his desk as president. Instead, he said that situation would not arise.  Harris on Friday plans to speak about two women who died in 2022. Amber Thurman and Candi Miller s deaths were a direct result of Georgia s six-week ban, according to reporting by ProPublica.

She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.   Georgia is a key battleground state that Biden narrowly won in 2020, beating former Trump by about 12,000 votes. Recognizing that she could not only rely on voters in the metro-Atlanta area to keep the state blue, Harris visited rural counties in southeastern Georgia during a two-day swing that culminated in a rally in Savannah.  Currently, Harris is neck-and-neck with Trump in the polls in the state, according to 538 s average. Trump leads by a one-point margin in Georgia, with 48% compared to Harris  47%.  The vice president is scheduled to head to Madison, Wisconsin, for a rally later on Friday evening."

She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia s pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate.   Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.   On Dungy s tweet, one commenter wrote,  I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.    I guess you didn t see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote  Yes  on it,  Dungy replied.  Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying,  I ll be voting no.  Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances.   President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,  Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign s press secretary, said after his NBC News interview.  Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump s abortion platform would make no exception  even for rape and incest.    A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  Harris said.   Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.   Trump said moments before Harris  statement he does believe  strongly  in exceptions for abortion.   I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,  Trump said during a debate.  I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.   Dungy is a one-time Super Bowl-champion coach, which came after his 12-4 season in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts.  Dungy began his head coaching career in Tampa Bay with the Buccaneers, going 54-42 with the franchise before moving to Indy, where he quickly became a legend with Peyton Manning as his quarterback.  Dungy went 85-27 in his 112 games leading the Colts.  Fox News  Emma Colton contributed to this report.

3,26,,Why Kamala Harris' Promises on Abortion Matter to Black Women,"In the absence of reproductive freedom, Black women historically went to great lengths to be self-determining.",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/why-kamala-harris-promises-on-abortion-matter-to-black-women/ar-AA1qQnYj?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Before rising to the top of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris championed safe, legal access to abortion. On the campaign trail she has promised that if Congress passes legislation restoring reproductive freedoms, as President she would sign it into law. Recent reports show that restrictions on abortion implemented since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade jeopardize women s lives and have led to a rise in infant deaths.  This is especially significant for African American women, who are poised to suffer the worst outcomes of six-week abortion bans in places like Georgia and Texas, since Black women account for an estimated 40% of those seeking to end pregnancies. That statistic reflects a web of interconnected factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality health care, and high maternal mortality rates. Plus, history shows that in the absence of choice and contraception, Black women have gone to painful and often harrowing lengths to be self-determining.  Prior to the passage of the 13th Amendment ending slavery, enslaved Black women were literally property and denied control over their reproductive systems. Enslaved women were often raped and forced to  breed  because their progeny amplified enslavers  wealth. Further, the children they conceived of their own volition, birthed, loved, and cared for could be sold for a profit or to repay enslavers  debts, never mind being subject to the quotidian brutality that enslavement itself entailed.  Read More: Reproductive Rights Are Taking Center Stage at the DNC  Against this backdrop, enslaved women found ways to end pregnancies, sometimes using herbs to induce menstruation, or they committed infanticide. Some hoped to spare children from the horrors of slavery. Others took a different view of the matter. For example, Letty, an enslaved woman, was indicted for crushing the skull of her newborn in Virginia in 1822. She told investigators,  If the child had been one of her own colour, she would not have done as she did.  Letty s extreme act and her sentiments gesture toward the trauma of interracial rape that marked so many enslaved women s lives, and the refusal by some women to mother infants stemming from it.  After Emancipation, Black women set about reclaiming and redefining their womanhood. The restoration of virtue and bodily sanctity were of paramount importance, and many felt that having a child out of wedlock would threaten those aims. Single mothers faced dire financial implications as well as harsh judgments by the broader society.  Even families with two parents struggled and often could not afford another mouth to feed. Most Black families relied upon the income of several working family members—mothers and fathers and daughters and sons able to secure employment did so and usually contributed to the household. But even with multiple revenue streams, poverty was grinding.  Moreover, the post-Emancipation period brought its own set of cruel ironies for Black women. While enslavement was outlawed, in a practical sense rape and sexual abuse were not, because the law failed to protect Black victims. African American women remained particularly vulnerable to sexual assault as domestics working in white people s homes and would have faced degrading stigmas from any pregnancies resulting from those assaults, in addition to the distressing circumstances.  We don t have statistics for how many Black women sought to terminate such pregnancies over a century ago. But it s clear that women used a variety of tactics to do so, demonstrating their desperation and their fury at the unfair restrictions over their lives. Some went to root doctors who prescribed herbal abortifacients, an unreliable solution since the elixirs could be toxic to women, frequently fatally so. Others went to underground abortionists who performed procedures that at the time, could be quite dangerous and deadly. Newspapers from the time were littered with accounts of women and girls who died from  criminal malpractice,  frequently a euphemism for botched medical abortions. Some women bled out quickly, while others suffered as they died from painful infections.  Read More: Rape Led to 64,000 Pregnancies in 14 U.S. States With Abortion Bans, Study Says  Given the great risks of available abortion options, some women decided to conceal their pregnancies, carry to term, and kill the infants after birth, as Henrietta Thompson did in Philadelphia in 1887. Impoverished, pregnant, and unwed, she gave birth and, according to court records and newspaper accounts, placed the infant in a cesspool. Upon discovery of her actions, she explained to police officers that she had to  go out and work for a living and could not afford to pay its board.   Other women abandoned newborns at centers colloquially referred to as  baby farms.  At best, these operated as infant care centers for working mothers. On the other end, however, some proprietors subjected the children in their care to neglect that could lead to malnutrition, illness, and even death.  Mattie Burke, a Black woman operator of a notorious baby farm in Philadelphia in 1914, was charged with causing the deaths of three infants in her care. Pictures of their emaciated corpses were shown in court. Even as the mothers were distraught, one of the women defended Burke. For some, she and similar practitioners performed what was considered a necessary evil. So, while papers decried the squalid conditions in which the infants were kept and the fact that a single tin of condensed milk was shared among the children in Burke s care for a week, new mothers continued to patronize such haunts with newborns in tow.  Read More: How American Women Could Lose the Right to Birth Control  Women pressed for legal access to safe and effective birth control and, in 1960, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first oral contraception. Five years later with Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court protected the right to use contraceptives. In 1973, the Supreme Court upheld abortion rights. The decades after the passage of Roe v. Wade were not without flaws, but access to abortion paired with the advent of widely available birth control afforded Black women and girls greater avenues to avoid conceiving before they were ready to parent and safely end unwanted pregnancies if they did. These allowed them to be the stewards of their own reproductive systems.  But with the Dobbs decision overturning Roe, and with more than a dozen states banning abortion completely or severely limiting access, those gains are vulnerable. Today, a lack of access to abortion doesn t just imperil Black women s health, it also leaves them at greater risk of criminalization—as we saw in Ohio in 2023, for example, where a Black woman named Brittany Watts who had a miscarriage was arrested on charges of having abused a corpse. (The charge against her was ultimately dismissed.)  It would be easy to leave histories like Letty s, Henrietta Thompson s and Mattie Burke s in the past, but their legacies demonstrate something essential. Denying women choice does not prevent them from terminating pregnancies. Rather it compels those with few options to take dangerous risks to exercise reproductive rights. That might seem like hyperbole, but recent research suggests that only a fraction of rape and incest victims in states with bans have access to safe, legal abortions—even when those same states claim to have exceptions for these scenarios. No women and girls should have to face such horrors in America in the 21st century.

3,27,,State Asks Judge to Pause Ruling That Struck Down North Dakota's Abortion Ban,The state of North Dakota is asking a judge to pause his ruling from last week that struck down North Dakota's abortion ban ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/state-asks-judge-to-pause-ruling-that-struck-down-north-dakotas-abortion-ban/ar-AA1qQMjm?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The state of North Dakota is asking a judge to pause his ruling from last week that struck down the state s abortion ban until the state Supreme Court rules on a planned appeal.  The state s motion to stay a pending appeal was filed Wednesday. State District Judge Bruce Romanick ruled last week that North Dakota s abortion ban  is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,  and that pregnant women in the state have a fundamental right to abortion before viability under the state constitution.  Attorneys for the state said  a stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues.   In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to an abortion. Soon afterward, the only abortion clinic in North Dakota moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, and challenged North Dakota s since-repealed trigger ban outlawing most abortions.  In 2023, North Dakota s Republican-controlled Legislature revised the state s abortion laws amid the ongoing lawsuit. The amended ban outlawed performance of all abortions as a felony crime but for procedures to prevent a pregnant woman s death or a  serious health risk  to her, and in cases of rape or incest but only up to six weeks. The law took effect in April 2023.  The Red River Women s Clinic, joined by several doctors, then challenged that law as unconstitutionally vague for doctors and its health exception as too narrow. In court in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, the state asked the judge to throw out the lawsuit, while the plaintiffs asked him to let the August trial proceed. He canceled the trial and later found the law unconstitutional, but has yet to issue a final judgment.  In an interview Tuesday, Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said the plaintiffs would oppose any stay.   Look, they don t have to appeal, and they also don t have to seek a stay because, like I said, this decision is not leading any time soon to clinics reopening across the state,  he said.  We re talking about standard-of-care, necessary, time-sensitive health care, abortion care generally provided in hospitals or by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and for the state to seek a stay or to appeal a ruling that allows those physicians just to practice medicine I think is shameful.   Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 bill, said she s confident the state Supreme Court will overturn the judge s ruling. She called the decision one of the poorest legal decisions she has read.   I challenge anybody to go through his opinion and find anything but  personal opinions,   she said Monday.  In his ruling, Romanick said,  The Court is left to craft findings and conclusions on an issue of vital public importance when the longstanding precedent on that issue no longer exists federally, and much of the North Dakota precedent on that issue relied on the federal precedent now upended — with relatively no idea how the appellate court in this state will address the issue.

3,28,,Hochul moves to bolster struggling abortion amendment,Kathy Hochul is steering more than $1 million toward a flagging effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/hochul-moves-to-bolster-struggling-abortion-amendment/ar-AA1qRgEk?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"ALBANY, New York — Gov. Kathy Hochul is steering more than $1 million toward a flagging effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution — a move that could shore up her party s chances in key House races.  The cash infusion is designed to bail out a struggling campaign for the amendment amid Democratic fears that a well-organized opposition has gained traction with voters.  Hochul s renewed focus is also meant to silence alarm bells from Democratic operatives that top state party leaders have not done enough to support the ballot referendum and that a strategy to leverage the amendment to boost turnout could backfire.  The money will be used for TV ads as well as direct mailers to voters. Hochul is also expected to speak more publicly about the amendment and its potential impact on protecting abortion rights in this deep blue state.   It s critical voters know that an abortion amendment is on the ballot in New York this year,  Hochul said in a statement.  New Yorkers deserve the freedom to control their own lives and healthcare decisions, including the right to abortion regardless of who s in office, and this important investment will get that message out across the state.   But the referendum s fate — and Hochul s push for it — is intertwined with swing House races.  The Democratic governor has made flipping five GOP-held House seats in the state a political priority this year following criticisms from fellow Democrats like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  Known as the equality amendment, the referendum being put to voters is meant to guarantee a broad array of rights in the state constitution, including the right to an abortion.  But critics have seized on the proposed amendment s broad language, which includes rights for LGBTQ+ people.  Opponents have warned the amendment would lead to a host of unintended consequences, such as trans people participating in women s sports or a weakening of statutory rape laws.  Supporters have contended those claims amount to fear mongering and have decried the anti-trans rhetoric. Voters statewide back the amendment, 64 percent to 23 percent, according to a Siena College poll released Thursday.  But as POLITICO first reported this month, Democratic consultants working in key House races have pointed to internal polling that found arguments against the proposal were effective with battleground seat voters — especially in the crucial New York City suburbs.  Opposition to the amendment, in turn, could hurt Democratic candidates running in down-ballot races, the consultants said.  New York is considered to have some of the strongest laws on the books protecting access to abortion.  But as the Supreme Court two years ago moved to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democratic state lawmakers approved a package of measures meant to solidify abortion rights in New York. That included the equality amendment — a proposal that includes protections for  pregnancy outcomes  as well as a ban on discrimination based on gender identity. Notably, the amendment does not include the word abortion.  The way in which state lawmakers crafted the amendment has given opponents an opening as well. Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, Hochul s 2022 gubernatorial opponent, announced Thursday that he s starting a campaign to urge voters to reject the amendment in order to  save girls  sports.   Democratic lawmakers who crafted the language were at odds over how expansive to make the proposal, a process that did not directly include Hochul. Some legislators believe it was a mistake to not center the amendment solely around abortion rights.   I thought we should have been much more direct and much clearer in the language we re using,  said Tom Abinanti, a former Democratic assemblymember.  As you can see there s some confusion over the language.   Hochul had initially cheered the amendment s wide-ranging language as a way of protecting all New Yorkers.  A constellation of left-leaning organizations and reproductive-rights groups last year formed a campaign, known as New Yorkers for Equal Rights, meant to boost the amendment. But their effort failed to raise a promised $20 million to promote the measure.  State elections filings this summer showed that the committee has less than $1 million in cash on hand.  As a result, finger-pointing has ensued at a pivotal moment in the election season.  The lack of robust fundraising hasn t gone unnoticed among New York Democrats who believe Hochul was being unfairly blamed for the bumpy campaign to get the amendment approved.   An abortion ballot initiative in New York should have been a walk in the park, but for all of the bluster of the progressive organizations associated with Prop 1, it s been a case study in how not to run a professional campaign,  said a New York Democrat who was granted anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions.  On Thursday, New Yorkers for Equal Rights cheered the help, though did not mention Hochul by name.   New Yorkers for Equal Rights is proud to be powered by a broad and growing coalition across the Empire State, and every new partner who joins the fight helps bring us one step closer to permanently protecting abortion on Election Day,  said Sasha Ahuja, the campaign s director."

Initially I did not want the public to know my pain,  Amber Nicole Thurman s mother, Shanette Williams, told the audience at the Unite America rally, where Harris was joined by Oprah Winfrey.  I wanted to go through it in silence, but I realized that it was selfish.  Thurman, a 28-year-old medical assistant, died two years ago after doctors at Piedmont Henry Hospital in the Atlanta suburbs waited 20 hours before performing a procedure called dilation and curettage to treat a rare complication she d suffered after taking abortion medication. She d arrived at the hospital after vomiting blood and passing out, ProPublica reports, and doctors had quickly determined that her uterus had not expelled all of the fetal tissue in her body.  Thurman died on the operating table, with a state committee comprised of 10 doctors later calling her death  preventable.   Her death came as doctors were grappling with Georgia s new abortion laws, which made the dilation and curettage procedure a felony offense in most cases.  This week, Harris blamed the tragedy on  Trump s abortion bans,  insisting they are  preventing doctors from providing basic medical care.  During his White House tenure, Donald Trump appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices — all of whom voted for the overturning of Roe v Wade, which guaranteed abortion access.   This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  Harris said in a statement.  This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care.   On Thursday, Williams told the crowd that she wanted them to know  Amber was not a statistic.    She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would ve done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed,  she added.  Describing herself as  broken,  Williams told the audience that she experienced  the worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent, could ever feel.   ProPublica had previously reported that as Thurman lay in her hospital bed, urgently awaiting treatment, her blood pressure sank, and organs began to fail. When doctors finally performed the operation, some 20 hours after she d arrived at the hospital, Thurman pleaded to her mother:  Promise me you ll take care of my son.   Williams had no idea that her daughter had been pregnant, the publication said.  The Independent has contacted Georgia Maternal Mortality in the Georgia Department of Public Health and Piedmont Henry Hospital for comment.  Since 1986, The Independent has campaigned for what we believe in, not what we are told to believe, with integrity, inclusion, innovation and independence as our guiding principles."
4,33,,"Cannabis, abortion and the border on state ballots","Notably, abortion will appear on ballots in 10 states this year. It’s an issue proven to draw voters, evidenced in the ...",https://news.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-abortion-border-state-ballots-150000846.html,"(NewsNation) — The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has dominated national headlines, but voters can also expect to see more localized ballot initiatives in November.  Voters in several states will make consequential choices on issues like abortion, election systems, same-sex marriage, border laws and cannabis.  How to register to vote  The outcome of some measures may impact the presidential race in those states.  Notably, abortion will appear on ballots in 10 states this year. It s an issue proven to draw voters, evidenced in the so-called  blue wave  that turned out for the 2022 midterm elections after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier that year.  Here s a look at some of the most common ballot measures voters will decide in November:  Abortion  Border  Cannabis  Abortion  Rank choice voting  Noncitizen voting  Abortion  Efforts to enshrine abortion access are on the ballot in a record 10 states this year — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota.  Meanwhile, voters in Nebraska will decide between a pair of dueling constitutional amendments, one of which seeks to ban abortion after the first trimester — with exceptions. The state already bans abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and requires patients to wait 24 hours after mandated counseling before they obtain an abortion.  The ballot initiatives would generally secure a person s right to an abortion and block laws that restrict or ban access to abortion services. Some proposals, like Arizona s Proposition 139, include specific language defining fetal viability, but each leaves that determination to a patient s health care provider.  Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot measures  Although they all seek to protect abortion access, the proposals  language and tactics vary. Places like Maryland and Missouri would more broadly guard a person s right to make decisions about the prevention, continuation or ending of their pregnancy. In Missouri, that would include a right to make and carry out decisions about  prenatal care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions.   New York Proposal 1 doesn t specifically mention abortion but could protect access to it through broadened antidiscrimination laws. It would amend part of the state constitution that protects against  unequal treatment based on race, color, creed and religion.  If approved, the proposal would include language to also protect against  unequal treatment based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes, as well as reproductive healthcare and autonomy.  New York lawmakers have debated revising the proposal to directly address abortion rights.  Colorado Amendment 79 additionally seeks to repeal an existing ban on state and local funding for abortion services.  Border  Arizona s Proposition 314 would create new state crimes surrounding several border- and immigration-related issues. If passed, the measure would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state anywhere other than through a port of entry and would allow state judges to order deportations. State and local police would also be allowed to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization.  The measure would make it a Class 2 felony for an adult to knowingly sell fentanyl that results in another person s death. Notably, a person could argue the merit of those charges if they show the fentanyl s precursor chemicals were manufactured in the U.S. or lawfully imported into the country.  Proposition 314 would also require people seeking certain public benefits to use an E-Verify program to confirm their immigration status. Submitting false information during that process — or giving false information to an employer to avoid eligibility questions — would also be a crime.  Cannabis  Ballot initiatives in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota will ask voters to legalize the recreational use of cannabis.  Florida s Amendment 3 would legalize recreational pot use for people 21 years and older and would allow for possession of as much as three ounces.  South Dakota s Initiated Measure 29 and North Dakota s Initiated Measure 5 would both legalize recreational cannabis. If passed, North Dakota s measure would allow people to possess as much as one ounce of pot, four grams of concentrate and 300mg of edibles. It would also allow residents to grow three cannabis plants or six plants per household.  Recreational marijuana use is already legal in 24 states.  Wages  Workers could see increased pay and added benefits in some states if voters pass wage-related ballot initiatives.  Measures in Alaska and Missouri would raise the hourly minimum wage to $15, while a California proposal would raise the minimum wage to $18 per hour. Alaska s current minimum wage is $11.73 per hour as of Jan. 1. Missouri and Alaska pay their workers a minimum hourly rate of $12.30 and $11.73, respectively.  Massachusetts  Question 5 also proposes steadily raising the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the state minimum wage by 2029.  In Nebraska, Initiative 436 would require employers to offer as many as seven or at least 20 days of paid sick leave, depending on the company s size.  Meanwhile, tipped workers in Arizona could see their hourly rate reduced. Proposition 138 would allow employers to pay tipped workers 25% less than minimum wage if they earn the state minimum plus $2 per hour for all hours worked.  Rank choice voting  The option to adopt rank choice voting will be on the ballot in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Alaska and Missouri.  The model allows voters to rank candidates by preference. A candidate who receives more than half of the No. 1 slots wins. Races that don t result in a majority winner continue to a runoff election, where the contender with the fewest votes is eliminated until a majority winner is clear.  Maine, New York City, Cambridge, Minneapolis and San Francisco already use the model, and Alaska held its first ranked voting election in 2022.  How do Donald Trump, Kamala Harris  net worths compare?  Voters in other states will also weigh potential changes to the election process. Ballot initiatives in Montana and South Dakota would introduce top-four and top-two ranked choice-style primaries, respectively.  Arizona s Proposition 140 would similarly replace the existing partisan primaries with a system that allows all candidates to appear on one ballot before the top choices advance to the general election. An opposing Arizona measure, Proposition 133, would ban open primaries and ranked voting methods.  Noncitizen voting  Voters in eight states — Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin — will weigh in on proposed noncitizen voting bans.  Voting in a federal election as a noncitizen has been a crime for more than a century and is punishable by fines and prison. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, are also banned from voting in state and most local elections, except for select municipalities.  The issue gained renewed traction as a Republican talking point earlier this year after former President Donald Trump suggested without evidence that Democrats were encouraging people to enter the United States without authorization.  Each U.S. state already has laws criminalizing noncitizen voting. The November ballot measures seek to bolster those bans by reflecting them in the states  constitutions. They would also block local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote.  Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta Friday to respond to the deaths of two Georgia women linked to the state s abortion ban, according to a ProPublica investigation released this week.  Amber Thurman, 28, a nursing assistant and mother of a 6-year-old son died after doctors delayed necessary care due to Georgia s six-week abortion ban, says the story reported by Kavitha Surana. Medical providers stalled to provide care to treat the effects of a medication abortion, also known as a medical abortion, the investigation says.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  After sharing Thurman s death, Surana reported a second story on another Georgia woman named Candi Miller who died as a result of not seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.   To tell their stories, ProPublica reviewed medical documents, autopsies and official state committee reports, interviewed family and loved ones, spoke with government officials and consulted medical experts, doctors from across the state and U.S. and people inside hospitals.  Here s what the ProPublica investigation found and what to know about Georgia s abortion law.  ProPublica: Amber Thurman, Candi Miller die under Georgia s abortion law  ProPublica s investigation explores the stories of two women who died after Georgia s strict abortion law went into effect in July 2022. The law bans abortions after six week of pregnancy with few exceptions.  According to ProPublica, Thurman became pregnant with twins unexpectedly in 2022 and faced roadblocks to receiving reproductive care due to the state s ban. She went to North Carolina for a medication abortion but experienced rare complications after taking the prescribed abortion pills.  Thurman became septic in the hospital due to excess tissue in her uterus that did not shed from her body, causing a serious infection. Thurman needed a dilation and curettage, or D&C, a procedure in which tissue is removed from inside the uterus. However, Georgia s ban considers a D&C a felony if performed outside of specific circumstances and could land doctors behind bars for up to 10 years.  Thurman s health deteriorated for 20 hours before doctors finally took her to surgery. By then, it was too late, ProPublica s reporting says. Her heart stopped on the table.  Thurman s death was  preventable,  according to Georgia s maternal mortality review committee, which said the hospital s delay in providing the D&C due to state law  had a large impact on her fatal outcome,  ProPublica reports.  Candi Miller was a 41-year-old Georgia woman with chronic health issues including lupus and hypertension that made carrying a pregnancy life-threatening.  Already a mother of three, Miller became pregnant in the fall of 2022. Fearing for her life, she did not want to keep the pregnancy. But she found that the exceptions to the Georgia abortion ban only applied to imminent and acute life-threatening emergencies and did not extend to chronic health conditions, even those that can become lethal in pregnancy, ProPublica reports.  Unwilling to wait until things became more dire, she opted out of going to a doctor s office for fear of legal repercussions and instead underwent abortion on her own, ordering pills online. She suffered a rare complication but was reticent to seek medical care, her family later told officials. She was found unresponsive on Nov. 12 at home.  An autopsy found fetal tissue in her uterus as a result of the incomplete abortion as well as a combination of pain pills. Her family said she had avoided seeking medical care  due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.  The state committee also deemed her death  preventable,  reports ProPublica.  What does Georgia s abortion law say?  In Georgia, abortion is banned after six weeks with some exceptions. Georgia passed the six-week ban in November 2022, and it was upheld by the state supreme court in 2023.  The ban has some exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother up to 20 weeks. Critics say six weeks is too soon because studies have shown that women generally don t discover they are pregnant until they ve at least missed one period, around five to six weeks into gestation. Some experts and healthcare workers have criticized the law as having vague, difficult-to-interpret language and restrictive stipulations around what qualifies as an  exception.   Some of the specific language that impacted Thurman s case is explored in-depth in ProPublica s report.  Supporters commend the legislation for correcting what they saw as unconstitutional laws under Roe v. Wade. Some believe life begins at conception, meaning they feel they are protecting the life of a baby in the womb. Other supporters say that abortion was too widely and loosely used before the law went into place or that their religious beliefs compel them to support restrictions. Supporters also maintain that the exceptions outlined in the bill are ample to protect the health of mothers and babies.  The  heartbeat  law, known as the LIFE Act, has been the subject of some back-and-forth in state courts, having initially been blocked by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney who previously ruled the ban  unequivocally unconstitutional  on the grounds it was introduced in 2019 before the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  The higher court, however, determined in October of last year that the new precedent set by the reversal is now the standard by which to judge abortion-related matters in a 6-1 decision.  Responses to ProPublica s investigation  Some organizations issued statements in response to ProPublica s reporting.  Nancy Northup, President & CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights said, in part:  Amber Thurman should be alive today. Her death was preventable—her doctors knew how to perform the very basic medical procedure needed to save her life, but felt their hands were tied because of the state s abortion ban. The Georgia lawmakers who passed this ban are ultimately responsible for her death, and the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.   Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs (AAPLOG) said, in part:  Amber Thurman s tragic death, recently covered by multiple news organizations, was caused by side effects of legal abortion drugs and medical negligence, not pro-life laws. Despite taking the drugs as she was instructed and seeking timely care when she experienced complications, she still died.   What has Kamala Harris said about abortion bans?  Presidential candidate Kamala Harris responded to the ProPublica piece with a statement on social media Tuesday:   A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,  she said of Thurman.  Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump s actions.   Harris will also be addressing abortion bans in a planned speech in Atlanta on Friday.  What has Donald Trump said about abortion bans?   President Trump has always supported exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which Georgia s law provides,  the Trump campaign told USA TODAY in response to the death of Thurman.  With those exceptions in place, it s unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect Amber Thurman s life.   Trump has often said he believes the issue should be left up to the states.  In late August, the former president criticized Florida s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in an interview with NBC, saying  I think the six-week is too short; it has to be more time.  A day later, however, he announced he would vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would overturn the ban, citing concerns it would result in  ninth-month  abortions."

Trump is to blame.  In Madison, Wis., a crowd that had been ebullient suddenly grew hushed as Ms. Harris spoke about her visit with the family of a Georgia woman who died of sepsis after waiting for more than 20 hours for medical care to treat an incomplete medication abortion.   She was a vibrant 28-year-old,  Ms. Harris said.  Her name, Amber Nicole Thurman, and I promised her mother I would say her name every time.   Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris traveled to Georgia, where Ms. Thurman and another woman, Candi Miller, died after delays in medical care tied to state abortion restrictions, according to reporting by ProPublica. Their deaths occurred in the months after Georgia passed a six-week ban made possible by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.  In Atlanta, Ms. Harris condemned the deaths of the two women in an impassioned speech, saying that Mr. Trump had caused a  health care crisis  and that women were being made to feel as  though they are criminals.   Ms. Harris s stops in the two battleground states capped a relatively smooth week for her campaign as Mr. Trump again caused or confronted several politically unhelpful headlines and controversies. Most strikingly, the Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, whom Mr. Trump has praised as  Martin Luther King on steroids,  was found to have called himself a  Black Nazi  and praised slavery in a pornographic chat room.

4,36,,"Health care, abortion and Ukraine: How Vance has gotten ahead of Trump on policy","JD Vance has been proposing policy ideas for addressing some of the country's most pressing issues, even though Donald Trump ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/health-care-abortion-and-ukraine-how-vance-has-gotten-ahead-of-trump-on-policy/ar-AA1qVmA2?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Since joining the Republican ticket, vice presidential nominee JD Vance has hit the ground running with campaign events and interviews, often dubbed a  policy attack dog  for former President Donald Trump s campaign.  But as Election Day approaches and both presidential candidates are pressed for details of how they ll carry out their agenda, Vance has been putting forth policy ideas for addressing some of the country s most pressing issues -- even though Trump has lacked the same clarity.  One of the most public examples of this occurred during the ABC News presidential debate when Trump did not commit to vetoing a national abortion ban after Vance had said on NBC s  Meet the Press  that he would do so. Trump told the moderators he had not discussed the topic with Vance.  MORE: Key takeaways from Harris-Trump ABC News debate   Well, I didn t discuss it with JD, in all fairness,  Trump said.  When the debate moderators asked Trump what his health care plan would look like, he said it was not fully developed yet.   I have concepts of a plan,  Trump said.  I m not president right now, but if we come up with something, I would only change [Obamacare] if we come up with something that s better and less expensive.   Asked on NBC s  Meet the Press,  if Vance could clarify the former president s plan, the Ohio senator went further on details, saying Trump would pursue a  deregulatory agenda.    We want to make sure everybody is covered, but the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a one-size-fits-all approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.   On foreign policy, Vance, in alignment with Trump, has been critical of the United States  involvement in Ukraine and the billions of dollars of aid the country provided to Ukraine s war effort against Russia.  In a recent podcast interview, Vance laid out a potential approach a Trump administration would take in handling the Ukraine-Russia war, including creating a  demilitarized zone  in the parts of Ukraine that Russia has already taken over.   So I think what this looks like is Trump sits down. He says to the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Europeans,  you guys need to figure out what does a peaceful settlement look like,   Vance said on the  Shawn Ryan Show  last week.  And what it probably looks like is something like the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine. That becomes like a demilitarized zone. It s heavily fortified so the Russians don t invade again. Ukraine remains its independent sovereignty.   MORE: Assassination attempt suspect was fixated on Ukraine, sources said. Here s what Trump has said about the war.  Vance also said the rest of Ukraine that Russia did not occupy would be a  sovereign state  and that Russia would get the  guarantee of neutrality.    Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine. It doesn t join NATO, it doesn t join some of these sorts of allied institutions, and I think that s ultimately what this looks like.   Vance s suggested plan is the most specific policy outline the Trump campaign has offered regarding how it would handle the Ukraine-Russia war.  During the ABC News debate, Trump refused to answer if he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia when pressed twice. Instead, Trump said it would be in the country s best interest for the war to end and pushed for a deal to be negotiated, without offering specifics.   I think it s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done,  Trump said.  All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.   Doug Heye, a GOP strategist, told ABC News that many could view Vance s actions as filling in the policy gaps in Trump s agenda.   Trump isn t a series of policy proposals, he s an attitude,  Heye told ABC News.  MORE: Lack of communication, drone issues plagued Secret Service at Trump Pennsylvania rally: Report  Referring to Trump saying during the ABC News debate that he had not discussed the issue of possibly vetoing a federal abortion ban with Vance, Heye said anyone close to the former president should prepare for him to possibly not have their backs.   Anybody near Trump needs to be prepared for him to throw them under the bus. That s part and parcel of who he is. And I don t necessarily even say that as a criticism. It s just, you know, sort of fact,  Heye said.  How much of this is freelancing versus planned? You know, we don t know, but that possibility is always there.   William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, told ABC News in a statement that Vance and the former president aligned in their vision for the country.   President Trump and Senator Vance are totally aligned in their America First policy vision, and JD always follows President Trump s lead on the issues,  Martin told ABC News.  ABC News reached out to the Trump campaign for comment as well, but didn t hear back by the time of publication."
4,37,,"At a star-studded online rally with Oprah Winfrey, Harris discusses abortion rights, immigration and gun ownership",Vice President Kamala Harris sought to capitalize on the star power of Oprah Winfrey and a host of Hollywood celebrities ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/at-a-star-studded-online-rally-with-oprah-winfrey-harris-discusses-abortion-rights-immigration-and-gun-ownership/ar-AA1qSxql?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris sought to capitalize on the star power of Oprah Winfrey and a host of Hollywood celebrities to help her win over persuadable voters during an online rally Thursday night that ranged from participants  searing accounts of personal loss and trauma to the Democrat s unguarded remark about her own gun ownership.  During the  Unite for America  event in Michigan, Harris also reflected on the change that Winfrey said she and others had observed in the vice president once she became the Democratic Party s standard-bearer.   It seems to us that something happened to you the moment Joe Biden, President Biden, stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power,  Winfrey said.   We each have those moments in our lives where it s time to step up,  Harris responded, adding that she felt a  sense of purpose,  given the stakes of November s election.  The event sought to capitalize on the skills and star power of Winfrey, who delivered her coveted endorsement of Harris at last month s Democratic National Convention. At times, the night evoked Winfrey s long-running talk show, with Harris taking questions from the media mogul and listening to members of the invited live audience gathered in a suburb of Detroit. Celebrities, ranging from Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts to comedian Chris Rock, chimed in virtually.  The livestream was geared, in part, at mobilizing grassroots activity on Harris  behalf in the hopes of edging past former President Donald Trump in what Harris campaign chairwoman Jen O Malley Dillon told the audience remains a  margin-of-error race.   Before the event kicked off, Harris  campaign said that nearly 200,000 people had RSVP d through the official sign-up – with even more expected to join on the array of social media platforms on which it was streaming.  A discussion of reproductive rights included Hadley Duvall, an abortion rights advocate who was raped and impregnated by her stepfather when she was 12 – as well as members of the family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia mother who ProPublica reported died in 2022 from a treatable infection due to delays to her medical care stemming from the state s restrictive abortion law.  Shanette, Thurman s mother, spoke publicly about the case for the first time during Thursday s livestream, saying,  Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain.    I wanted to go through in silence, but I realized that it was selfish. I want you to know, Amber was not a statistic, she was loved by a family, a strong family,  she added.  Harris, who is set to travel to Georgia on Friday to deliver remarks on women s reproductive rights, apologized to Thurman s family.   I m just so sorry,  the vice president said.  And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary, because also you just learned about how it is that she died. … And Amber s mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind, is preventable. Preventable. That word keeps coming to her.   Harris and the livestream audience also heard from 15-year-old Natalie Griffith, a student from Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, who was shot twice during a campus attack earlier this month.  Natalie, who had a cast on her left arm, was joined by her parents, Marilda and Doug, who demanded more action.  We have a job, that job is to protect our children,  an impassioned Marilda Griffith said.  We have to stop it.   Harris, who discussed owning a gun during her recent debate with Trump, reiterated Thursday that she believes it is a  false choice  to suggest someone is either in favor of the Second Amendment or wants to take everyone s guns away.  Winfrey noted that she had not known that Harris was a gun owner – prompting an off-the-cuff quip from the vice president.   If somebody breaks in my house, they re getting shot,  Harris said.   I probably should not have said that,  she added, laughing,  but my staff will deal with that later.   Harris also faced questions about some of the difficult policy issues confronting her in this contest – ranging from inflation to dealing with illegal immigration.  Asked by an audience member about her plan to  strengthen  the border, she outlined the measures to improve border security that had been included in a bipartisan congressional bill that Trump helped to kill.  Under questioning from Winfrey, Harris said she would work to revive the legislation and sign it into law should she win the White House."

4,39,,"Harris Assails Trump Over Georgia Abortion Ban, Woman’s Death","Vice President Kamala Harris spotlighted the death of a woman in Georgia who was unable to obtain access to a legal abortion, ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/harris-assails-trump-over-georgia-abortion-ban-woman-s-death/ar-AA1qVov5?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"(Bloomberg) -- Vice President Kamala Harris spotlighted the death of a woman in Georgia who was unable to obtain access to a legal abortion, laying the blame on Donald Trump and his role in the US Supreme Court overturning protections for the procedure.   This is a health-care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect,  Harris said during a rally in the metro Atlanta area Friday, taking her pitch to protect women s reproductive rights to a swing state where Democrats are using the issue to rally suburban women and independents to the polls.   He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words — quote —  I did it, and I m proud to have done it,   Harris continued, casting Trump as  proud that women are dying, proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care, proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.   Harris referred to state restrictions on abortion rights as  Trump abortion bans  and said one in three women in America live under such laws. And she assailed the former president for saying he would vote to preserve a Florida law that limited abortion in the state to the first six weeks of a pregnancy.  The Democratic presidential nominee discussed the case of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year old mother, who died in 2022 from an infection arising from an abortion.  Thurman s case was documented in a ProPublica investigation that found that under Georgia s abortion ban, at least two women in the state died after failing to get medical care in the aftermath of the Supreme Court s ruling striking down Roe. That court decision led to states across the country imposing restrictions on abortion and making reproductive health a defining issue of the 2024 presidential race. The report cast Thurman as the first abortion-related death that officials deemed preventable.   We knew that this could happen. There is the word preventable and there is another word — predictable,  Harris said.  The vice president delivered the remarks a day after she met with the family of Thurman during a town hall with talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. At the town hall, Thurman s mother said her daughter  was not a statistic  but a real person.  Harris on Friday said she had promised Thurman s mother that  Amber is not just remembered as a statistic.   Abortion is an issue that has put Trump on the defensive. As president, he nominated three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe and has used that to solidify his standing with evangelical voters and his grip on the Republican party. But with polls showing that Americans at large support abortion rights, Trump has also sought to neutralize the issue in part by re-branding himself as a champion of reproductive rights.  That pivot has highlighted how the issue is an electoral liability for the former president and has sparked criticism from both Democrats who call him insincere and religious voters who are worried he will soften on the issue.  During their lone scheduled debate so far, Harris repeatedly pressed Trump on whether he would veto a bill imposing a national ban on abortion — a question the Republican nominee deflected by saying he  wouldn t have to,  insisting the issue is now up to the states.  Trump s messaging on abortion has been inconsistent. He s said he was open to restricting access to mifepristone, a pill used in medical abortions. Trump has also vowed to mandate that the federal government or insurance companies cover the entire costs of in vitro fertilization.  Harris has vowed to sign into law a measure that restores Roe s protections and said that if Trump was elected again  I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban.    I m trying to get another debate but we ll see,  Harris said on Friday. Trump has ruled out another debate against Harris, claiming he won their showdown even as polls show voters deemed the Democrat had the better performance.  Georgia has been a hotly contested battleground, one that Biden won in 2020 by fewer than 12,000 votes and where Trump is accused of leading a conspiracy to stay in office.  An August Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found Harris leading Trump in Georgia, 49% to 47%. Harris has ramped up her campaigning in the state, including a recent bus tour that sought to court people in rural communities and disaffected Republicans.  On Friday, the Georgia State Election Board approved a controversial new rule requiring all ballots to be hand-counted at each of the state s polling sites — a move that threatens to delay reporting of the state s election results and raises concerns about ballot security.

5,40,,Republicans Threaten Doctors Who Fail to Provide Emergency Pregnancy Care Amid Abortion Bans,"As doctors refuse to provide necessary care due to abortion bans, providers feel threatened by Ron DeSantis’ admin and ...",https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/republicans-threaten-doctors-who-fail-to-provide-emergency-pregnancy-care-amid-abortion-bans/ar-AA1qVCxn?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Florida health officials issued new guidance about abortion on Thursday, threatening to take  regulatory action  against doctors who delay in providing emergency medical care to pregnant patients, as providers say the state s abortion ban has doctors afraid to do their jobs and is putting patients at risk.   They know their law is what puts women in danger and they re just trying to threaten physicians so that we feel scared, rather than taking accountability for what their law is doing to people,  an OB-GYN in Florida tells Rolling Stone. She asked that her name not be used because the state controls her license and she fears retaliation for speaking out against them.   You can t legislate an individual person s health care decisions because all it does is create mayhem for the patient and the doctor involved,  said the physician. She says the new guidance just further muddies the waters about what s legally permissible under the state s six-week ban.  It s playing politics and trying to cast blame on doctors,  she added.  In the wake of the Supreme Court s 2022 decision allowing states to ban abortion, reports have trickled out around the country of patients who are unable to obtain necessary medical care, as doctors worry they will be prosecuted. Florida s six-week ban went into effect in May; under the law, doctors who perform abortions can face felony charges and up to five years in prison.  That law was signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose administration is now openly campaigning against a ballot measure to restore abortion access in the state. The Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Health Department sent all licensed physicians a provider alert yesterday, claiming to  address misinformation currently being spread concerning Florida s abortion laws.   The alert points to several exceptions to the abortion ban.  The law is clear: abortion is permissible at any stage of pregnancy in Florida to save the life and health of the mother,  the guidance says. They add that a failure to provide life-saving treatment to pregnant patients without delay  may constitute malpractice  and  regulatory action  will be taken against providers.  The American Civil Liberties Union says, in reality, the ban  makes it difficult for survivors of rape, incest and human trafficking to access an abortion in Florida. Under the ban, survivors of rape, incest, and human trafficking are required to provide documentation of their assault, and if they don t, they will be required to carry and give birth. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking after the fifteenth week of pregnancy.   The ACLU adds that the ban s exceptions for a pregnant patient s health are  inaccessible  and  endanger patients  health, safety, and future fertility.   Lauren Brenzel is the campaign director for Yes on 4, the ballot measure that would relegalize abortion in the state. They say it s tough to be an OB-GYN in Florida right now.   You are simultaneously being told you are going to prison if you make a mistake and provide abortion in a context they don t consider valid, while also being threatened with regulatory action and malpractice if you do not provide that care,  Brenzel tells Rolling Stone.  It s an impossible choice - physicians are being threatened on all sides by the government intervening in their medical decisions.   Abortion rights supporters in the state find the timing of the state s new guidance to be a political calculation. The guidance was issued days after the nonprofit Physicians for Human Rights released a report about the consequences of the state s abortion ban. It contained harrowing stories about cancer patients, underage rape survivors, and women miscarrying who had difficulty obtaining care this summer, following the state s six-week abortion ban.   Instead of [responding with] guidance on how to keep people healthy and protected, they re sending out intimidating letters to every licensed physician,  says Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida alliance of Planned Parenthood affiliates. Goodhue said that after the guidance was issued, she received an influx of questions from doctors and nurses across the state.   Doctors don t know what to do,  said Goodhue.  It s damned if you do and damned if you don t.  She said she usually hears from the doctors she works with, but this was a much larger amount. They were telling her they were confused, that they felt they d already been following the law, and one maternal fetal medicine specialist told Goodhue she found the guidance offensive.   She was like, I ve never been so offended - I m in this work because I want to protect mothers and babies, that s what I do,   recounts Goodhue.  In addition to being a major talking point in this year s election, particularly in Florida, the national abortion conversation heated up this week with ProPublica s reporting on two Black women in Georgia whose deaths were  preventable  but happened as a consequence of the state s abortion ban.  One of the women, a single mother named Amber Thurman, was diagnosed with  acute severe sepsis  which would typically be treated by a common minor surgical procedure called a dilation and curettage, or D&C. But doctors, afraid of potentially violating a new George abortion ban, waited 20 hours to operate and Thurman died.  Last night, Thurman s family attended Oprah s virtual campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris.  People around the world need to know that this was preventable,  said Thurman s mother, Shanette.  You re looking at a mother that is broken. The worst pain ever, that a mother, that a parent, could ever feel.   Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, emphasized Shanette s words that Amber s death was  preventable  and that abortion bans criminalizing health providers can have fatal consequences, even when there are exceptions for the life of the mother.   Here s the problem with that: Is she on death s door before you actually decide to give her help? Is that what we re saying,  said Harris. She added that politicians, including Donald Trump,  think they re in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care.   On Friday afternoon, Harris brought up Thurman s case during a campaign event in Atlanta. She described Thurman as a  vibrant  and  ambitious  28-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy.  We will speak her name - Amber Nicole Thurman,  said Harris, leading the crowd in a chant repeating her name. Harris pointed out that the two Georgia deaths reported on by ProPublica are  only the stories we know here.  Because of how maternal mortality data is reviewed in states, there is a lag in reporting on preventable deaths such as Thurman s.  As controversy grows over the health consequences of abortion bans in states like Florida and Georgia, Republicans are increasingly characterizing these cases as  misinformation  or saying that doctors are misunderstanding the law.  In Louisiana, Attorney General Liz Murrill released a six-page statement with similar language to Florida s health department. She claimed the media and politicians are spreading  disinformation  about Louisiana s abortion ban.   To be clear: nothing in Louisiana laws stands in the way of a doctor providing care that stabilizes and treats emergency conditions,  said Murrill.  Any statements to the contrary are flatly incorrect. Any hospital or doctor at any hospital or emergency room who refuses to treat and stabilize a woman having a miscarriage or suffering with an ectopic pregnancy could be committing both medical malpractice and violating federal law.   Murrill s statement comes after increased pressure on Louisiana for passing an unprecedented law reclassifying common pregnancy care pills, including misoprostol, as controlled dangerous substances. Hundreds of doctors have spoken out about concerns the law will cause delays in care for women, particularly since misoprostol is used to treat postpartum hemorrhage and will be removed from obstetric carts.  Goodhue says it s typical for anti-abortion politicians to pass laws that endanger women, and then try to deflect blame for the consequences.   It s the way that they operate - through intimidation and bullying. It s been going on since we ve had protesters outside of our clinic since Roe v. Wade [was originally decided],  she says.  Women have been judged and shamed for accessing health care for 50 years. And now it s state sponsored intimidation and bullying. "
5,41,,Missouri Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to keep abortion rights on the Nov. 5 ballot,"Abortion rights remained on Missouri’s Nov. 5 ballot by the slimmest of margins, according to opinions released Friday by the ...",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/missouri-supreme-court-ruled-4-3-to-keep-abortion-rights-on-the-nov-5-ballot/article_b4ca9cde-777e-11ef-8f9c-37df85035dfc.html,"Abortion rights remained on Missouri s Nov. 5 ballot by the slimmest of margins, according to opinions released Friday by the Missouri Supreme Court.  In a 4-3 decision on Sept. 10, the high court reversed a ruling by Cole Court Circuit Court Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who had recommended removing Amendment 3 from the ballot, saying the initiative petition had been deficient.  The majority opinion was written by Judge Paul Wilson, with Chief Justice Mary Russell, Judge Robin Ransom and Judge Brent Powell concurring.  The dissent was authored by Judge Kelly Broniec, with Judge Zel Fisher and Judge Ginger Gooch concurring in the dissent.  Amendment 3, if approved by a simple majority of Missouri voters, would legalize abortion up until the point of fetal viability and protect other reproductive rights, including birth control. Abortion is illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for victims or rape or incest.  The Supreme Court, while divided, made one point clear in both the majority and dissenting opinions:  this case is not about abortion.    It concerns only what information the constitution requires proponents to include on any initiative petition,  Wilson wrote in the majority opinion.  It is about form and procedure, not substance.   Wilson was appointed to the court by then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. Russell was appointed by former Democratic Gov. Robert Holden. Powell was appointed by former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, and Ranson was appointed by current Republican Gov. Mike Parson.  Broniec and Gooch were also appointed by Parson; Fisher was appointed by Republican Gov. Matt Blunt.  The initial case stemmed from a lawsuit filed in late August by a group of anti-abortion lawmakers and activists claiming the initiative petition that was later certified and approved as an amendment, failed to follow a number of laws.  This includes a section of state law requiring initiative petitions  include all sections of existing law or of the constitution which would be repealed by the measure.   The plaintiffs — state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, state Rep. Hannah Kelly, anti-abortion activist Kathy Forck and shelter operator Marguerite Forrest — sued Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft arguing the initiative petition failed to state any laws that would be repealed if it passed.  Attorneys for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the campaign behind the ballot measure, have said the amendment would not repeal the state s current abortion law or take it off the books. Instead, they told the courts, it would create a new law that would supersede much of the existing one because not every element of the current law would be rendered moot, including laws protecting women who get abortions from prosecution.  They also argued anything that falls under the scope of the amendment would be left to the judicial system to interpret and not truly repealed just in the amendment s passing.  A majority of the Supreme Court ruled that interpreting the law to require listing every possible provision that could be impacted by an amendment would have  absurd effects.    It seems reasonable to expect that few — if any — initiative petitions could survive under such a statute,  Wilson wrote.  He added that to interpret the statute as such would be unconstitutional because it would impede citizens  right to the initiative petition process.   In fact,  Wilson wrote,  it is hard to imagine how a statute could impair and impede the initiative process more.   Broniec, in her dissent, took a broader interpretation of the word  repeal,  saying that it is also defined as the ability to  effectively render invalid.   She called the majority opinion  an absurd result contrary to the plain language  of the state constitution.  If Amendment 3 passes, Broniec wrote, Missouri s current abortion ban cannot continue to stand. She noted a handful of other current laws that could be in conflict with the amendment, including parental consent for minors and the mandatory 72-hour waiting period between meeting with a doctor and receiving an abortion.  The Supreme Court published its decision on Sept. 10, a few hours after oral arguments were completed and less than three hours before the constitutional deadline to remove a question from the ballot.  Coleman, one of the plaintiffs and an attorney, said in a statement Friday,  The court was right about one thing in today s released opinion, their decision isn t about abortion. It is about abrogating the will of the general assembly by using absurd arguments to reach their desired result.

5,42,,Tony Dungy just called out Kamala Harris over religion and abortion,The former Indianapolis Colts head coach and current NFL analyst disagrees with the vice president's take on religion and ...,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2024/09/19/tony-dungy-crticizes-kamala-harris-religion-abortion/,"Tony Dungy has an issue with Vice President Kamala Harris  claims about faith and abortion.  The former NFL coach and current NFL analyst called out Harris on Thursday, explaining that her ideas about faith are not like his own.   Exactly what  faith  are you talking about when you say you don t have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)?  Dungy posted on X.  Tony Dungy criticizes Kamala Harris  Dungy s comments came in response to a post from Harris  personal X account featuring a comment she made about abortion during the Sept. 10 presidential debate.  Harris said then that religious Americans are among those who object to strict state-level abortion bans, as the Deseret News previously reported.   One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  Harris said.  In his post Thursday, Dungy argued that you do have to abandon the Christian faith to promote abortion rights.  If you aren t abandoning your faith, then it must mean you have a very different idea of what being religious entails, he implied.   Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general  faith  that says we re good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What  faith  are you talking about?,  Dungy wrote.  Religious teachings on abortion  Dungy is far from the only Christian to believe the Bible is against abortion, but Harris  view is common, too.  Research has shown that majorities of many major faith groups support abortion rights.  For example, Pew Research Center reported earlier this year that most Catholics (59%), Black Protestants (71%) and white nonevangelical Protestants (64%) in the United States believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.  Harris, who identifies as Christian and belongs to a Baptist church, has made protecting abortion access a key part of her pitch to voters.  Tony Dungy on abortion  Dungy s comments Thursday are unsurprising if you ve followed his life outside of football.  The Pro Football Hall of Famer has taken part in the March for Life in Washington, D.C., and he posts regularly on social media about his Christian faith and his opposition to abortion.  In the lead up to the election, Dungy has been posting often about his opposition to Florida s Amendment 4, a proposed amendment that aims to protect access to abortion in the state."
5,43,,"Missouri Supreme Court voted 4-3 to keep abortion amendment on ballot, opinions show",The state Supreme Court last week issued an order keeping the proposed state constitutional amendment – called Amendment 3 – ...,https://news.yahoo.com/news/missouri-supreme-court-voted-4-190446827.html,"The Missouri Supreme Court only narrowly rejected arguments raised by anti-abortion activists who tried to keep a measure overturning the state s abortion ban off the November ballot.  The state Supreme Court last week issued an order keeping the proposed state constitutional amendment – called Amendment 3 – on the Nov. 5 ballot. The judges  decision came hours before a deadline to finalize the ballot and they didn t explain their reasoning at the time.  The court on Friday released a full opinion that goes deep into the its rationale, revealing a 4-3 divide over the last-ditch attempt to block a vote on the proposal.  In the majority opinion, Judge Paul Wilson wrote bluntly that the case was  not about abortion  but instead what information must be included on initiative petitions.  The legal dispute centered on whether the amendment sufficiently described what laws it would repeal, fulfilling a requirement for ballot measures. Abortion opponents argued it did not, while abortion rights supporters said opponents were misreading the requirement.  Wilson, an appointee of former Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, found that requirement in state law effectively irrelevant because restrictions on the power of initiative petitions can only be found in the constitution.   So, the question is only what the constitution requires,  Wilson wrote, noting that the state Supreme Court has never held that the state constitution requires a petition to identify all state laws that may later be declared invalid.  Chief Justice Mary Russell, Judge Robin Ransom and Judge Brent Powell concurred with the decision.  The amendment would prohibit the General Assembly from banning abortion until fetal viability, defined in the measure as the point in pregnancy when there s a significant chance the fetus can survive outside the womb without extraordinary medical measures.  The amendment allows but does not require, lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability; the GOP-controlled legislature would almost certainly pass a ban on abortions late in pregnancy.  Any post-viability ban would be required to allow at least three exceptions – for the life, physical and mental health of the woman.   Because Amendment 3 does not purport to repeal any existing constitutional provision and is not so utterly and completely inconsistent with any existing constitutional article or section as to constitute a direct conflict or irreconcilable repugnance, Opponents  first challenge fails,  Wilson wrote.  The Missouri Supreme Court s order on Sept. 10 came after Cole County Circuit Court Judge Christopher Limbaugh ruled against the measure after anti-abortion activists filed a lawsuit seeking to toss it from the ballot.  Limbaugh, an appointee of Republican Gov. Mike Parson and a cousin to the late conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, found the amendment didn t comply with a requirement that ballot measures outline what state laws they would repeal.  Lawyers for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the main campaign for the amendment, swiftly appealed the decision to the Missouri Court of Appeals, which in turn handed the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.  Only Judge Kelly Broniec, an appointee of Republican Gov. Mike Parson, dissented. Broniec argued that the state law requiring measures to list statutes that would be repealed is presumed constitutional.   Because Amendment 3 had to follow Missouri law … and did not do so, I would affirm the circuit court s judgment,  Broniec wrote.  Judge Ginger Gooch and Judge Zel Fischer concurred with Broniec s dissent."
5,44,,"Pennsylvanians overwhelmingly trust Kamala Harris more than Donald Trump on abortion, Inquirer/NYT/Siena poll finds","Abortion is Kamala Harris' strongest issue with Pennsylvania voters, according to the latest survey from The Inquirer, New ...",https://www.inquirer.com/politics/harris-trump-abortion-stance-pennsylvania-poll-voters-20240920.html,"As Vice President Kamala Harris works to build a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans, abortion remains her strongest issue among Pennsylvania voters.  A poll from The Philadelphia Inquirer, New York Times, and Siena College found Harris held a 25-point lead on Trump on the issue with 59% of likely voters trusting her more on the issue, slightly higher than President Joe Biden s lead on the issue in April.  Harris has centered reproductive rights as one of the themes of her campaign as former President Donald Trump has struggled to find a consistent message on the issue.  Even before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, Harris was a key messenger for Democrats on reproductive rights. She proved her strength discussing the issue during her debate against Trump last week. The poll was conducted Sept. 11 to 16, the six days that immediately followed the debate.  The crucial Philly suburbs were especially supportive of Harris on abortion issues as 72% of likely voters in the counties said she was better equipped to handle the issue. The collar counties helped deliver Biden s victory in the state in 2020 and could again determine the outcome this fall.  Discussing abortion while debating Trump in Philadelphia last week Harris focused on the stories of women denied medical care because of state restrictions on the procedure. She also referenced stories of young victims of rape and incest who had to cross state lines to obtain abortion care.   The government, and Donald Trump, certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,  Harris said.  That message resonated.   I m Catholic, so I can t say I would actually have an abortion, but I think everybody should have that choice. And not have to be in fear. Or risk their life to do it,  said Jessica Storment, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia who plans to vote for Harris.  Trump, who appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, insisted he did not support federal restrictions on abortion and argued the Dobbs decision rightly returned the issue to states. However, he would not say if he would veto a federal ban on abortion if Congress sent one to his desk.  He sought to paint Harris as extreme, claiming she supports abortions very late in pregnancy — which are extremely rare. Harris has said she supports codifying the abortion protections within Roe v. Wade, which would protect access to abortion until fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy.   They re radical, the Democrats are radical in that,  he said.  Despite Trump s claims to the contrary, the poll found that 49% of Pennsylvanians, including 71% of Philadelphia respondents, believed that Trump would try to pass national restrictions on abortion if elected.  Even supporters of Trump told pollsters they trusted Harris more on abortion.   When it comes to … women s … reproductive health rights, that s the big thing for me. Because you know, things happen whether you plan it or not,  said Kylie Dickens, a 25-year-old from West Grove who plans to vote for Trump.  So, you know, I get definitely nervous on that aspect of him going into office. I don t agree with him on that sense.   A strong majority of likely voters in Pennsylvania support legal access to abortion with 66% of respondents saying abortion should be always or mostly legal. Only 26% said it should be always or mostly illegal.  Reproductive rights will be a key motivating issue for Democrats in November up and down the ballot.  In the Pennsylvania Senate race Republican Dave McCormick has sought to pivot away from abortion, instead talking about reproductive rights from a lens of broadening access to fertility treatment.  Still, 49% of respondents said they trusted the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Bob Casey — 19 percentage points higher than the number who trusted McCormick on the issue."
5,45,,Harris Twists Tragic Story of Two Deceased Georgia Mothers to Slam ‘Trump Abortion Ban’,Vice President Kamala Harris opportunistically took advantage on Friday of the deaths of two Georgia mothers to slam the ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/harris-twists-tragic-story-of-two-deceased-georgia-mothers-to-slam-trump-abortion-ban/ar-AA1qVPIl?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris opportunistically took advantage on Friday of the deaths of two Georgia mothers to slam the state s  Trump abortion ban,  a term she coined to criticize her presidential opponent s stance on abortion.   Now we know that at least two women — and those are only the stories we know — here in the state of Georgia died because of a Trump abortion ban,  Harris said during a 24-minute speech in Atlanta.  Earlier this week, ProPublica reported that Amber Thurman, 28, and Candi Miller, 41, died in 2022 as a direct result of Georgia Republicans  six-week abortion ban following the Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade that year. The investigative news outlet claimed Thurman died due to a delayed abortion and that Miller died in her home because she was afraid to seek an abortion after the ban took effect. However, the reality turns out to be more complicated.  The two women took chemical-abortion pills and, as a result, suffered severe complications with their respective pregnancies. In both cases, some fetal tissue remained in their uteruses. A dilation-and-curettage (D&C) procedure was needed to remove the septic fetal tissue. While Thurman underwent the surgery, Miller did not and tried to self-manage the abortion.  A Georgia committee of maternal-health experts deemed these deaths  preventable,  blaming the state s pro-life heartbeat law. The committee concluded that the delayed D&C procedure had a  large  impact on Thurman s fatal outcome and said Miller s death was not caused by the abortion medication.  There is still much unknown about their tragic deaths, though, given that the full reviews of individual patient cases are not made public.  Despite this, Harris amplified ProPublica s reporting on X and linked Thurman s death to the so-called Trump abortion bans. She did the same during a Friday afternoon speech in Atlanta, where both mothers died two years ago.   We will speak her name: Amber Nicole Thurman,  Harris said, leading the crowd to repeat after her:  Amber Nicole Thurman.  Notably, she did not directly name Miller.  On Thursday, the Democratic presidential nominee met with Thurman s family at her Michigan rally with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. During her speech on Friday, Harris said she spoke with Thurman s sisters and mother.   I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic,  Harris said.  People will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today.   The event marked the vice president s first speech solely dedicated to abortion since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket. She hopes to mobilize voters on the issue, contrasting herself with former president Donald Trump s abortion policies.   Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action,  Harris falsely claimed. Georgia s six-week abortion ban, as Dr. Christina Francis pointed out in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed, explicitly enables doctors  to intervene in cases of medical emergencies or if the fetus has no detectable heartbeat,  both of which were true of Thurman s situation.  While agreeing that their deaths were completely preventable, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America state policy director Katie Daniel noted how  Georgia s law and every pro-life state law calls on doctors to act in circumstances just like theirs.   Daniel accused abortion advocates of exploiting the stories of Thurman and Miller:  If abortion advocates weren t spreading misinformation and confusion to score political points, it s possible the outcome would have been different.   During her Friday remarks, Harris pushed back against Trump and his running mate, Senator J. D. Vance (R., Ohio), for saying they believe in exceptions to save a mother s life in cases of rape or incest. She doesn t think they do.   Think about what we are saying right now,  the Democratic candidate said.  You re saying that good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying that a health-care provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die.   Harris furthermore claimed that Trump would sign a national abortion ban should he be reelected, despite the Republican nominee s saying during last week s presidential debate that he wouldn t sign one. She also cited Trump s past statements taking credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was responsible for sending the abortion issue back to the states.  Meanwhile, Harris reiterated she would prevent a federal abortion ban from becoming law and  proudly  sign a bill to  restore reproductive freedoms  if she wins the November election.

5,46,,Kamala Harris denounces Trump for abortion bans after ‘preventable’ deaths,Vice President Kamala Harris Friday denounced former President Donald Trump for pushing extreme abortion bans after a ...,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/kamala-harris-denounces-trump-for-abortion-bans-after-preventable-deaths/ar-AA1qVIpV?ocid=BingNewsVerp,"Vice President Kamala Harris Friday denounced former President Donald Trump for pushing extreme abortion bans after a bombshell new published report called the deaths of two Georgia moms  preventable.   The Democratic presidential nominee slammed Trump for backing restrictive abortion laws like Georgia s, which a state panel said played a  large  role in the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller.   Amber waited 20 hours excruciating hours, until she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they could (legally) treat her,  Harris told hundreds of supporters in suburban Atlanta.  But they couldn t save her.    It s heartbreaking,  Harris added.  Harris derided Trump and vice presidential running mate JD Vance as  hypocrites  and worse for claiming their anti-abortion policies are pro-family.   It should not be Donald Trump or the government telling women what to do with their own bodies,  she said.  How dare he.   The speech came a day after Harris held an emotional meeting with Thurman s family during a town hall with Oprah Winfrey on live television.  Harris choked back emotion after hearing the grieving family recount the story of her death.   I m just so sorry,  Harris told Thurman s mother.  Thurman, the mother of a young boy, died in 2022 after suffering rare complications from abortion medication.  She went to the hospital after suffering severe symptoms, but doctors did not immediately treat her amid fears they could face criminal charges under Georgia s newly enacted Republican law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.  A state medical panel recently ruled Thurman s death as  preventable  and said delays in providing care played a  large  role in her death, Pro Publica reported this week.  Miller, 41, died at home after taking abortion medication when she became pregnant. Relatives say she declined to go to the hospital to seek treatment for fear of being criminally charged under the law.  The state panel also called Miller s death  preventable.   Democrats believe abortion rights is a key issue for them in the 2024 election and Harris has relentlessly pounded Trump on it.  Democrats have enjoyed an uninterrupted string of wins in elections where abortion was a key issue ever since 2022, when the conservative Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that had legalized abortion nationwide.  Voters in several states, including red states like Kansas and Ohio, have voted in favor of abortion rights, and several other states are voting on similar ballot measures in November.  Trump has been put on the defensive by abortion rights-related attacks. He has previously proudly boasted of appointing the three conservative Supreme Court who overturned Roe.  But he has recently stressed that he believes that laws passed by his Republican allies like those in Georgia that ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy are too harsh and also that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.  Despite Trump s claim that he has a more moderate stance on abortion, he still says he will vote against a Florida ballot measure that would restore abortion rights and overturn the Sunshine State s six-week ban.  ________"

It was the first time the family had spoken out since the investigative news outlet reported this week on Amber Nicole Thurman s death after the 28-year-old left the state in 2022 to secure the abortion pill and could not receive the care she needed from a Georgia hospital when a complication arose.  Advertisement   This story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place,  Harris told the woman s mother and sister, who were seated in the audience for a live-streamed campaign event hosted by media mogul Oprah Winfrey.   And in state after state, including yours, these abortion bans have been passed that criminalize health care providers — in a couple of states, prison for life, Oprah, prison for life ... for a doctor or a nurse providing health care,  Harris said, blaming her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, for appointing the U.S. Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022.  Here s the problem with that — so she s on death s door before you actually decide to give her help ... like, literally a doctor or nurse has to say she might die any minute?   The woman s mother, Shanette, spoke out for the first time, delivering an emotional account of losing her daughter in what a medical examiner deemed a preventable death after doctors waited 20 hours to perform a surgical procedure that may have saved her life. Georgia law criminalizes practitioners who perform abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.   I want y all to know Amber was not a statistic,  Shanette said.  She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.   Advertisement  It was a powerful moment during an event that was clearly aimed at undecided suburban women. The live-stream was conducted in an interview format by Winfrey and featured a bevy of stars beaming in from expensive-looking rooms, including Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Chris Rock, Tracee Ellis Ross and Meryl Streep.  Winfrey s questions were tailored to persuadable voters with concerns about reproductive rights, the economy and immigration.  But during one awkward exchange on gun safety and school shootings, Harris declared:  If somebody breaks into my house, they re getting shot.  A moment later, she added:  Probably should not have said that.   Winfrey early on teed up a softball question for Harris on the influx of immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which has been subjected to bomb threats and chaos since Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, baselessly insisted the immigrant population there has been eating neighbors  cats and dogs.  Everybody in America — left, right, middle — has concerns about immigration,  Winfrey said.  Advertisement   I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people,  Harris said before stating she d back the bipartisan bill with resources for the border that Trump instructed congressional Republicans to kill earlier this year.   He preferred a run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,  Harris said of Trump.  He put his personal political security before border security,  Harris added.  Harris appeared before a live audience of 400 people in Oakland County, Michigan ― a swing state where recent polls show Harris leading Trump. Harris  campaign touted before the event that 200,000 people had committed to viewing it online as of Thursday afternoon.

In remarks focused solely on abortion rights, Harris in Atlanta invoked the name of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old Georgia woman who died of an infection after a rare complication from taking medication abortion.   We will speak her name: Amber Nicole Thurman,  Harris said, leading the crowd in a call and response.  Amber Nicole Thurman.   According to a recent ProPublica report, Thurman waited 20 hours in a suburban Atlanta hospital after seeking medical care for an incomplete abortion before doctors tried to give her the treatment she needed.  A state medical board review said she died largely because of the hospital s delay in treating her and called it  preventable.    We understand the impact of these bans, and the horrific reality that women and families, their husbands, their partners, their parents, their children, are facing as a consequence every single day since Roe was overturned,  Harris said.   The reality is, for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many of the stories we re not hearing, but where suffering is happening every day in our country,  she continued.  Thurman s family met with Harris at her  Unite for America  rally Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan.  During her remarks Friday, Harris said she spoke with Thurman s sisters and mother.   I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic,  Harris said.  People will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today.   Trump repeatedly brags about his role in getting Roe overturned, and the speech was part of the Harris campaign s effort to tie the consequences of state abortion bans directly back to him.   Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action,  Harris said, pushing back on Trump s embrace of exceptions to abortion bans.

Wade in 2022, 10 states will have reproductive rights-related questions on the ballot this November, leaving it up to voters to directly decide how the procedure will be regulated.  Voters in six states have already upheld abortion rights through ballot initiatives since Roe was overturned.  Three states -- California, Michigan and Vermont -- voted to enshrine abortion rights in 2022. Two other states -- Kentucky and Montana -- voted against further restricting access to abortion. In Kansas, voters struck down a proposal to remove the right to abortion from the state constitution.  Nine states have proposals on the ballot this fall that specifically mention abortion, while a measure in New York addresses general reproductive rights and issues.  Arizona  A ballot initiative in Arizona would amend the state constitution to establish a fundamental right to abortion. It also protects access to abortion after fetal viability if a health care provider determines an abortion is needed to protect the life, physical or mental health of the patient, using clinical standards and evidence-based medicine, according to Arizona For Abortion Access, a coalition supporting the amendment.  The initiative would also prevent the state from penalizing anyone who assists another person in getting an abortion. Some states have sought to criminalize the actions of family and friends who help patients access abortion care, including driving a woman to get an abortion or paying for their abortion care.  The initiative garnered over 820,000 signatures from Arizona voters, far exceeding the 384,000 signatures the state requires to appear on the ballot, according to Planned Parenthood of Arizona.  Arizona currently has a 15-week abortion ban in effect without exceptions for rape or incest. Earlier this year, state lawmakers repealed an 1864 near-total ban on abortion.  Colorado  If approved, a ballot initiative in Colorado would amend the state constitution to add a right to abortion, prohibiting the government from denying, impeding or discriminating against exercising that right, according to the Colorado secretary of state.  The amendment would also prohibit health insurance from denying coverage for abortion. A 1984 amendment had caused the denial of health insurance coverage for abortion services for state and local public employees even in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal conditions or cases where the pregnant mother s life is at risk, according to the Colorado secretary of state.  The measure codifies abortion rights, even though state law already allows abortions and has established it is a fundamental right. In 2023, Colorado also enacted a shield law prohibiting state agencies from cooperating with out-of-state investigations and legal actions stemming from reproductive health care provided in Colorado.  Florida  An initiative in Florida would amend the state s constitution, outlawing legislation that prohibits, penalizes, delays or restricts abortion care before viability or when necessary to protect the patient s health.  The amendment would still allow mandatory parental notification of minors who get abortion care.  Florida currently has a six-week ban in effect, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. If approved, the provision would allow abortions to resume in a state that was a key access point for abortion care for women across the South, before the state s ban went into effect in April.  Prior to the six-week ban, abortions were permitted through 15 weeks of pregnancy.  Maryland  A ballot initiative passed by the legislature would add an article to the Maryland Constitution establishing a right to reproductive freedom, allowing people to make decisions surrounding their own pregnancy. The state would be prohibited from directly or indirectly burdening or abridging the right unless justified by  a compelling state interest achieved by the least restrictive means,  according to the wording.  In Maryland, abortion is legal until viability. After viability, abortions are still permitted in cases of fetal anomalies or if the woman s life or health is endangered.  Missouri  A ballot measure in Missouri would amend the state constitution to prohibit the government from being able to deny or infringe upon anyone s right to reproductive freedom -- which gives people the right to make and carry out decisions including abortion care, miscarriage care, birth control, prenatal care, child birth and postpartum care.  The initiative would allow the legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion after fetal viability, except in cases where a provider finds that an abortion is needed to protect the life, physical or mental health of a pregnant person.  The initiative would also prohibit penalizing or prosecuting individuals who get abortion care or anyone who assists them in doing so.  Montana  If approved by voters, a ballot measure in Montana would amend the state s constitution, adding protections for the right to make and carry out decisions about one s pregnancy, including the right to abortion abortions.  The measure would also prohibit the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability and in cases where medical professionals determine it is medically indicated to protect the pregnant person s life or health.  New York  A measure introduced by the state legislature will be on the ballot in November that, if approved, would amend the state constitution to include anti-discrimination protections for pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care and autonomy.  Nebraska  If approved, a ballot measure in Nebraska would amend the state constitution to create a fundamental right to abortion, prohibiting state interference until fetal viability, in cases where there is significant likelihood the fetus could survive outside the womb or if the abortion is needed to protect the life or health of a pregnant patient, according to the secretary of state.  A second ballot measure would enshrine in the constitution a 12-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.  Nevada  A Nevada ballot initiative would amend the state constitution and make abortion access an individual right through fetal viability or whenever necessary to protect the life or health of a pregnant person throughout pregnancy, according to the Nevada secretary of state.  It would prohibit state and local governments from interfering with an individual s fundamental right to an abortion.  If approved by voters, the initiative will be placed on the general election ballot in 2026. The measure needs to be approved twice before it can go into effect.  South Dakota  A question on the ballot in South Dakota establishes a constitutional right to an abortion, but allows some restrictions based on the stage of pregnancy.  The amendment would prohibit the regulation of abortion through the first trimester.  In the second trimester, the state can only regulate abortion in ways that are  reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman,  according to the ballot measure.  In the third trimester, the state can regulate abortions except in cases when a medical physician finds an abortion is necessary to preserve the life or health of a pregnant woman, according to the measure."
