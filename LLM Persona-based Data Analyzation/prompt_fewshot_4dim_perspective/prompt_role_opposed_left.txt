    - Score: From -1 (extreme Against) to 1 (extreme Support), including decimal values.
  3. **Subjectivity**: 
    - Definition: The extent to which the article is based on facts. If the article uses emotional language, personal opinions, or relying on personal experiences, it is considered subjective. While the article uses facts, or statistics, it is considered objective.

  - For center or neutral label, scores can be close to 0 but not necessarily exactly 0. For example, a score of -0.1 or 0.2 could still be considered "Center" or "Neutral" if it's the most appropriate label.
  - If you are completely undecided, choose the label "Undecided" and assign a score of 0.
  - Make a judgment based on the text content alone, without personal opinion or bias.
  - Your response must be consist with your labeling and scoring, using decimal points to express nuanced interpretations.
  - Ensure consistency between your labeling and scoring.

  "title": "Trump calls for modifying 25th Amendment to make it possible to remove a vice president."
  "news_text": """
  Trump calls for modifying 25th Amendment to make it possible to remove a vice president. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday called for “modifying” the 25th Amendment to allow for the removal of a vice president who “lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president,” a political nonstarter and the latest escalation of his attacks on President Joe Biden and the change atop the Democratic ticket.
  “If you do that with a cover-up of the president of the United States, it’s grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office, beause that’s what they did,” Trump said during a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin.
  In the wake of Biden’s poor June debate performance and his decision to end his presidential campaign a month later, Trump and his Republican allies have accused Vice President Kamala Harris and top Democrats of covering up a decline in the president’s mental fitness.
  The Harris campaign declined to comment on Trump’s remarks on Saturday.
  The vice president has continued to defend Biden and his mental capacity, telling CNN last month that she doesn’t regret insisting in the weeks after the debate that Biden was fit to serve another four-year term.
  “Not at all,” Harris told CNN’s Dana Bash in her first major TV interview since becoming the new Democratic nominee. “He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.” Trump’s proposal comes as he continues to grapple with the changed dynamics of the 2024 race. In the midst of his struggles to land on a consistent message to blunt Harris’ momentum, Trump has continued to criticize Biden. During his Saturday rally, the former president said it was a “miracle” the president won the 2020 Democratic primary and mocked Biden’s performance at this March’s State of the Union and their June debate.
  “We’re run by stupid people — stupid, stupid people,” Trump said Saturday. “And we found that out at the debate with Joe. How did that work out?”
  The 25th Amendment lays out presidential succession and the process for removing a president, which would require the support of the vice president and a majority of the president’s Cabinet. It does not address forcibly removing a vice president. Ratifying a constitutional amendment requires the support of three-fourths of US states.
  Impeachment, a separate process that wouldn’t require amending the Constitution, requires a simple majority vote in the House to adopt articles of impeachment and then a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict. Trump was twice impeached by the House during his first term, but was not removed from office by the Senate.
  Trump’s call to alter the 25th Amendment invokes past calls to remove him from office. Some members of the former president’s Cabinet discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove him after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

{{

  "title": "Trump said he was the only person who could convince Putin to release Evan Gershkovich. He was wrong."
  "news_text": """
  In May, Trump said Putin would free journalist Evan Gershkovich  for me, but not for anyone else.
  Biden ended up negotiating Gershkovich s freedom in the largest prisoner swap since the Cold War. The complicated deal involved six countries and more than two dozen prisoners.  
  At the end of May, Donald Trump claimed on Truth Social that President Vladimir Putin would release Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter,  for me, but not for anyone else.  
  Today, President Joe Biden was the one to successfully bring Gershkovich home, along with two other American citizens and one green card-holder detained in Russia.  Biden announced the prisoner swap on Thursday, which included at least six countries and two dozen prisoners. 
  Gershkovich had been detained in Russia for nearly 500 days since his initial arrest and the US was continuously negotiating his release.  Trump made his May pronouncement as the Biden administration was engaged in those ongoing talks.   Evan Gershkovich, the Reporter from The Wall Street Journal, who is being held by Russia, will be released almost immediately after the Election, but definitely before I assume Office,  he wrote.  
  He will be HOME, SAFE, AND WITH HIS FAMILY. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, will do that for me, but not for anyone else, and WE WILL BE PAYING NOTHING!   In response to the claims, a spokesperson for the Kremlin said that Trump had no contact with Putin and spokesperson for the Biden campaign said that  for Donald Trump, these wrongfully imprisoned Americans are political weapons and props to use for his own gain.   A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to Business Insider s request for comment.  In addition to Gershkovich, Biden helped secure the release of Paul Whelan, a former US Marine detained since 2018; Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist; and Vladimir Kara-Murza, legal permanent resident in the United States.  Biden specified in a letter that in sum, 16 prisoners were released from Russia, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens. The prisoner swap, the largest since the Cold War, relied on multiple countries: Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey.  Speaking at a press conference, Biden emphasized the importance of ally relationships and thanked the countries involved in the deal, calling it a  powerful example of why it s vital to have friends in this world.  The president said that he had spoken to those freed on the phone and that they should be on American soil within a few hours.  When asked about Trump s comments that he alone could secure a deal from Putin, Biden fired a question back in response.   
  Why didn t he do it when he was president?

  "title": "Biden Resumes Immigration Program That Was Suspended Over Fraud Concerns"
  "news_text": """
  President Joe Biden's administration is set to resume an immigration program that was previously suspended due to fraud concerns.
  On Thursday, the Biden administration announced that it was resuming an immigration program that permits migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to enter the United States.
  The program was previously suspended over fraud concerns, but the announcement today that the updated program will include ”additional vetting” of their U.S.-based financial sponsors
  ”Together with our existing rigorous vetting of potential beneficiaries seeking to travel to the United States, these new procedures for supporters have strengthened the integrity of these processes and will help protect against exploitation of beneficiaries,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, obtained by the Associated Press (AP).
  The program was initially announced in January 2023 and seeks to expand pathways for immigrants to enter the U.S. legally while limiting asylum claims for those who cross the border illegally.
  The policy targets countries that send large numbers of migrants to the United States but typically refuse to accept deportees. It is coupled with commitments from Mexico to take back individuals from those nations who cross the U.S. border illegally.
  The U.S. will be accepting up to 30,000 migrants per month, under the program, from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The migrants will be given the opportunity to apply for a work authorization. In order to qualify for the program, migrants must have a U.S.-based financial sponsor who vouches for them and must arrive at an American airport at their own expense, rather than crossing the southern border. Both the sponsors and the migrants are subject to vetting by Homeland Security.
  Some Republicans have previously criticized the program and took aim at the Biden administration after it was suspended last month.
  In a statement following the announcement that the program will resume on Thursday, Republican Representative Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said, ”It should come as no surprise that the Biden-Harris administration has rushed to restart its unlawful CHNV mass-parole scheme, despite the clear evidence of fraud permeating the program. The CHNV program, along with the use of the CBP One app at the Southwest border, has helped the president and his border czar play a massive shell game, encouraging otherwise-inadmissible aliens to simply cross at ports of entry instead of between them.”
  ”My Committee has engaged with the department since this pause was announced, and the results were sobering. Instead of scrapping the clearly flawed program, the department is allowing it to continue without rooting out the fraud or putting adequate safeguards in place to prevent exploitation by sponsors here in the United States. But fundamentally, there would be no fraud to prevent if DHS simply stopped importing 30,000 inadmissible aliens every month in the first place,” Green's statement added.
