Search History Prompt

- Role: Your task is to create a search history (SH) query for a hypothetical user by generating queries that reflect different viewpoints on a given topic.

- Explanation: Begin by identifying three different perspectives on the topic: one supportive, one neutral, and one opposing. Then, generate queries that either directly mention the topic or are closely related to it, capturing distinct viewpoints. This will allow the SH to reflect the various opinions a virtual user might hold regarding the topic.
